Of course, many people develop expertise about distant places, but be aware that becoming an expert about your own backyard is easier, and as you indicate, gravity is already affecting your path.  I was committed to becoming a Europeanist, but living in North America represented a challenge. I lived in Europe for a year while continuing my studies, and at a critical point - a moment of truth - I had to decide the direction of my path and the shape of the rest of my life. I was offered the job of a lifetime - in the American West, and my new path shaped my future choices. I retooled to become an expert on my own backyard, which I found was really easy. I decided to resist gravity to a certain extent, to maintain my European research, but that hasn't been easy.  When I was your age, I found it impossible to listen to anyone who told me to change my passion - to give up on my ""Mesoamerica"" to pursue something that would be easier. I'm not sure what to tell you. If you are interested in archival and digitization, I suppose I would ask whether there are museums or archaeological collections containing Mesoamerican material near you where you could volunteer or otherwise become involved. I have watched many enthusastic young people who volunteered at these sorts of places only to find themselves on the payroll and building careers.  I suppose there isn't much here by way of suggesting a direction for you. If it would help to discuss further, don't hesitate to PM me. Best wishes."	human

2	"In this case, it is believed that Caesar was quoting from the works of the Greek playwright Menander, who's work Caesar was supposedly fond of. The meaning of the phrase is thus derived from the greek phrase ἀνερρίφθω κύβος, which is generally used in the context of games of chance and can also mean ""let the game be ventured"".   Whether Caesar used it speculatively or not, it's not known, but authors who wrote about the event such as Plutarch and Suetonius generally use the phrase in the sense of going beyond the point of no return. Lucan, however, avoids the phrase and simply describes Caesar as ""putting his trust in fate"". Plutarch, in his work The Life of Caesar, notes that this was a common proverb at the time used by any who begin bold or dangerous undertakings.  The sources that consider the quote are largely from around at least a century after his death. Many of them are distorted with some degree of mythologizing and poetics, particularly Suetonius and Lucan, who even have supernatural elements to their retelling of the events. It is likely that the main sources of Caesar's life were also generally written with some regard to one another, with only a couple that were not influenced by the writings of Plutarch or subsequent authors. However, it is believed that the quote and ""scene"" of the crossing is largely derived by Plutarch and a few other authors from the writings of Asinius Pollio, a subordinate of Caesar at the time. It's not exactly the highest degree of credibility, particularly as Asinius Pollio is believed to have softened his account of Caesar to make him appear more in tune with legalistic Roman values. However, given Plutarch notes that it was a proverb that had entered common vernacular, it does not stretch the boundaries of credibility too much to believe that it was said in a speech, or in some other way.  What is generally agreed upon from what I've found, however, is that it is believed to have been said in Greek, rather than Latin. The Latin derivative comes from the works of Suetonius, where it's presented in it's corrupted form - ""alea iacta est"" - instead of ""alea iacta esto"".  Hope that helps!  Sources:  Plutarch. *Life of Caesar.*  Rondholz, A. *Crossing the Rubicon. A historiographical study.*"	human

4	Well, let's pretend for a minute that monteary costs aren't a concern, and I was able to attend a larger university or relocate, at least in the country.

5	"Would also like an answer for this - I have heard similar lines of thought about Hellenism, or Ancient Greek religion, which is presented as a singular holistic religion, whereas the reality is it was almost certainly a vague and fluid mixing of various cults entering the Greek world at various times. For instance, would those who celebrate Dionysus in his cult really have a ""40,000 foot view"" of ""the entire religion""? The entire pantheon with all the myths of all the host of characters? Most certainly not."	human

7	That's a very good point- and one that spawns another thought! It seems there's really two things going on- one towards more granularity in ratings (as with Ebert's half stars), and one towards a higher maximum rating.  Google's ratings are still out of 5 stars, but they have decimals (0.0-5.0), so it's really out of 50. Is 5 stars a cultural thing? Will rating things out of 6 stars (hotels, Just-Eat) ever take off?  I'm curious as to how ratings have developed over time. It seems like something we take for granted when we see a 5/5 or a 10/10 (or a 5/7, heh) rating. For something so ingrained into my everyday experience, I find that I know surprisingly little about it.	human
8	"You don't need a strong ""aversion of war"" to try and avoid full scale war. Nor do you need a strong ""nuclear taboo"" to avoid situations where nukes are a preferable option.    The thing is that the Cold War lacks situations where nukes would have been an obviously great option, perhaps tactical nukes in Korea or Vietnam? But even without US superiority doesn't seem too good.   Other than these the USSR would actively have to create ""nuclear scenarios"" - which boils down to intent. Sure, if we know that the USSR is intent on launching a WW3 for world domination, then nuking everything seems obvious.  But there is no reason to assume this, and there is no reason to assume the USSR would put themselves in any ""nuclear scenario"", despite having atleast nuclear equivalencie. "	human

11	In Volume 18 of Cultures of Death and Dying in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, there are a few notes on the subject.  The first being that soldiers tried to use a variety of superstitious trinkets or prayers to try and avoid perishing, and this was further supported by Martin Luther, who believed that if fighting for a just cause (which was very limited), saying prayers and giving body and soul to God would prepared you for death.  Similarly, it was deeply rooted in beliefs at the time that soldiery, as a profession, was not wholly christian and it was difficult to reconcile war-making with virtuous behavior. If a soldier died in war, it was considered a consequence of sin.  The book also notes that typical services and traditions of last rites and burials were suspended in many cases throughout the period due to war, disease or other reasons. Therefore, it's likely that soldiers also would have fallen under the suspended service category, and get limited, if any attention, unless they were dragged off the field for burial.	human

15	&gt; Let's say I did just want to dgitization or archival work at a mueusm or something nearby: Would an education from only a community college even be sufficient for something like that?  It really depends. Right now, there's something of a crisis in the museum field: there are more museum studies BA and MA programs than ever before, and the graduates are competing for fewer jobs - many/most large museums drastically cut positions in response to the recession, and even as the economy started to recover, they didn't add them back. Any job listing for museum work gets way too many applications, and you'd be up against people with more relevant degrees and experience.  On the other hand, many tiny local museums in out of the way places cannot afford to pay enough to entice these grads to move there for temporary work (short-term, as in a six month contract position, or long-term, as in you plan to get a better job somewhere else eventually). If you happen to live in one of these places already and can make yourself look like a better prospect than the other locals applying for the job, due to having a history-focused degree from anywhere and a real passion for the work, you could still manage it.	human

17	"Volunteering at a local museum ""or something nearby"" is always a good start. You may discover a lot: what you like - and even what you don't like! You will find people who are willing to talk to you about what you want to do and what interests you. You may find employment, or the first steps needed for employment in the field may become apparent. Perhaps most importantly, as a volunteer, you can stop doing it as soon as you decide that it has nothing to offer you or that you're not interested. As a volunteer, you need to bring little to the table except your interest and enthusiasm. What follows is up to you and chance, and it's up to you to evaluate.  We once had a volunteer at an excavation I was funding; she developed an amazing ability to work in and then to run a field lab. With that skill, she acquired summer employment running field labs, supporting her effort to pursue a degree. With a BA in hand, I hired her for contract work in my office, organizing GIS-related data, during which time, she pursued her advanced degree. Once she had that in hand, I hired her for a permanent position. I since retired, but she still works there. I suppose that's something of a fairytale featuring a Cinderella, but it's not impossible, and you won't know the possibilities until you walk into an institution and ask what's possible."	human

20	I'd like to add a bit of homegrown experience here.   Antisemitism is a complicated issue in Argentina. In the mainstream, being antisemitic is a big no. [Here](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2081843-ursula-vargues-envuelta-en-una-polemica-por-una-actitud-de-diego-leuco-y-su-tuit-sobre-los-judios) you can find a huge scandal when a radio host made some... *impolite*... remarks about being jewish. It's just a sample - most people, employers even, would react harshly to antisemitic opinions expressed publicly.   Minorities are protected under the INADI (Instituto Nacional Contra la Discriminación, la Xenofobia y el Racismo - National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism), and [Law 23592](http://www.obserdiscriminacion.gob.ar/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ley-23592.pdf) against discrimination, which aggravates penalties for felonies commited with persecution of a minority - sexual, racial, religious, etc - as a motive.   Aside from the legal protections, however, there is a strong undercurrent of antisemitism and xenophobia in general in several instances. For instance, the Atlanta football club - located in a neighborhood  were many Jews live - has been the victim of vandalism and hooliganism with a very antisemitic flavor: swastikas painted in the walls, soap being thrown into the field when they come in, racist chants (I can illustrate, but I'd rather not). Football in Argentina is, to say the least, *very* racist in general. I can elaborate if anyone cares to know.   In business, being Jewish if anything is respected - the traditions of hard work and study are well received. At the government level, Jewish functionaries raise no eyebrows.    Neo-nazis are confined to small gangs, and an extremely marginal political party called 'Bandera Vecinal' that code their Nazi leanings in 'Nationalist' rhetoric, in order to be able to run for elections. Argentinean electoral law bans outward displays of racist iconography - swastikas, for instance.   The police and armed forces are historical reservoirs of antisemitic thought and action. While they have softened with the years, a lot of questions remain about the involvement of the Policía Federal Argentina in the AMIA and the Embassy terrorist attacks.   The book ['Shades of Hitler'](http://www.obserdiscriminacion.gob.ar/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ley-23592.pdf) is an in-depth investigation into neo-nazi gangs and their ties to the police and government organizations.

22	I think, even more than the actual granularity of the rating, you have to look at the granularity of the **reading** of the ranking.  Which is to say, I think because of the way things have been rated recently, people see a larger gap between 6 and 7 than between 7 and 8, and everything below a 5 might as well be the same, at least in a 1 to 10 scale. Similarly, with the google ratings, it may be in tenths, but people may not be acting in a way that recognizes a gap between 4.1 and 4.3.  Just my two cents.	human
23	Thanks for writing this, it was a very interesting read! And now for the follow-up  &gt; The Chinese, on the other hand, couldn't give a shit about theory. Their astronomy was primarily and almost exclusively focused on making accurate observations, without worrying too much about whether or not the observed phenomena were compatible with cosmological beliefs.  This, then, raises the question of what was their motivation for making these observations. I get the impression that they made a lot of observations over a long period of time, so they must have considered it important for some reason. My first intuition would be that observations are used to build models and therefore predictions, but, if I understood you correctly, that was not what the Chinese astronomers were after. So what was it?	human

Did I miss another?"	human
29	"There really wasn't just one specific reason but the broader reason is generally held to be to maintain her personal sovereignty and security. Which is a bit more complicated than ""didn't want to share power.""   To start off very broadly, Elizabeth was by nature an extremely cautious person. In every sense. When it came to foreign diplomacy, war, money (*especially* money), and political appointments. Sometimes that cautiousness lead to indecisiveness, which drove her council mad. So by her very nature a huge decision like marriage was never going to be one she took on lightly.   A primary concern of her's was that during this period a man was expected to dominate over his wife. A woman's property was expected to be turned over to her husband upon marriage. So, regardless of what title he had, any man she married would be expected to at the least exert a lot of influence and at the extreme become king of England, himself. This wasn't a hypothetical concern. Phillip's exact role during the reign of Mary I was a continuing problem. Contrary to perception, Mary, despite being very enamored of Phillip, was firm in her own sovereignty (Mary was as much a Tudor as her father and sister.) Phillip was titled king but he couldn't act without her consent or appoint minsters. Phillip was not pleased with the arrangement, which lead to tension in the marriage. And many blamed Mary's desire to please her husband with being involved in a war against France that eventually lost Calais. Although the loss of Calais was probably a good thing in the long run, it was seen as a disaster. And her marriage was not popular.    Elizabeth would want to avoid such a situation. So, choosing a husband was a very tricky matter from the outset. If she chose a foreign prince there would be endless negotiating over the terms. As there was in her many marriage negotiations. Marrying a subject may have been entertained but it was really a non-starter. Elevation of one subject above all others was a sure way to exacerbate factionalism (which was a problem in her reign.) This is even true when a king did it (Henry VIII's marriages within the realm did see the rise, and then sometimes fall, of the families connected to his wives and adjacent factional conflict.) But with a Queen it was a far greater issue because of what I discussed above about a man dominating his wife.   Religion was an issue. It's not as though there were no possible protestant matches. She and Eric of Sweden negotiated a possible marriage for a very long time. But marrying a Catholic wasn't necessarily an insurmountable problem. Elizabeth also had very serious marriage negotiations with the Archduke Charles of Austria that lasted years. In those it was promised he could have his own chapel for worship.   Elizabeth's final marriage negotiation was with Francis Duke of Anjou. And she seemed to take that very seriously. In the end, it was actually Parliament that urged her *not* to marry him and she was reportedly livid. She was in her 40s at this point. And even if she could have a child it would be very dangerous. The fear of losing the Queen in favor of an infant with a French royal father was too great. There was also objections over his religion. The strict Protestant faction grew over the course of her reign (although not with her encouragement.)   As talk of those negotiations suggests, it shouldn't be thought that in 1558 Elizabeth decided not to marry and then stuck with it. She considered various matches very seriously.   There was another benefit to her being single. She was able to play the marriage game for the first few decades of her reign. Marrying into England was a very valuable prize to dangle in front of a prince. Elizabeth was very concerned about the prospect of Catholic powers allying against Protestant England. But for as long as she could suggest a possible alliance with one or the other. Her most serious negotiations were with Charles of Austria, who like Phillip II was a Hapsburg, and two successive Dukes of Anjou (Henry then Francis) both sons of Henri II of France and Catherine de'Medici. This was very effective in maintaining peace, which was very important to her. And with the exception of small expeditions she reluctantly allowed in the Netherlands and the revolts in Ireland starting in the early 1580s, Elizabeth did keep England at peace for roughly 29 years. She ended Mary's war with France in 1559 and the Spanish Armada set sail in 1588.   Had she married into France or the Hapsburgs she could have been sucked into war much sooner. Had she married into Sweden her hand in marriage couldn't have been used as an alliance tool. Had she married a subject it would have brought her very little political gain at all.   Elizabeth ruled for 44 years. And her motives and the needs of her country changed over that time. Although she expressed her desire to remain single very early on, it wasn't just a random choice not to marry that she stubbornly stuck to.  Elizabeth was also very aware of the potential for rival courts to form around named successors. This had happened with her while her sister Mary was still alive. A husband and, especially, a son could be direct competition. (And Mary Queen of Scots did have this issue with her husband.)    The lack of succession plan certainly made people of her time very uncomfortable and uncertain. And it added a needless uncertainty when it almost every other area Elizabeth preferred stability over all else. Parliament urged her to marry in the first half of her reign and then urged her to name a successor in the later half. It can be glossed over in retrospect because the succession was very smooth. But it might not have been had she died sooner.   But, from Elizabeth's POV, the immediate problems that came with a potential marriage overshadowed the long-term issues of not producing an heir.

30	"I wrote an answer to an earlier, similar question [here, focusing on the Spanish Jesuit José de Acosta's description of Latin America's warmer climate](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4n4br4/did_the_first_european_explorers_14921600ish/d40yw6h/) which were published in the late 16th century. However, as I note there ""we don't get a clear description of the reversal of seasons yet, but still a disagreement with traditional authorities like Aristotle, who had described these regions as uninhabitable following European climate patterns.""  I'll add my summary from there to add context on how Acosta's views differed from the classical European canon:  &gt; The example of José de Acosta has shown first that the new experiences of the Americas led him to differ from Aristotle's highly influential views on meteorology. He described weather phenomena in South America that would have been impossible according to Aristotle: Including the hospitabilty of the lands despite being so far south, and his feeling cold despite the sun shining overhead. He did not make a reversal of the seasons more explicit in his work. These new views however did not mean that all classical knowledge was discarded with. The canon of bible and classical authors (incl. the geocentric model) remained an important frame of reference during this time period. Nonetheless, authors like Acosta out of necessity (due to the ""newness"" of the ""discoveries"") initiated a trend of turning to their own voice rather than traditional authorities to confirm the authority of their writings for European audiences who were far from the Americas.  However, I haven't come across contemporary explanations of the reversal of seasons from this time, so hopefully someone can add to this part of your question. In the thread to I linked above u/khosikulu interestingly discusses [Pigafetta's account of Magellan's circumnavigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4n4br4/did_the_first_european_explorers_14921600ish/d41p98e/), which is maybe a bit closer to describing the reversed seasons."	human

It's not technically unique as similar tactics became used in Japan during the sengoku Jidai at the end with the rise of massed yari ashigaru and matchlock formations under Oda Nobunaga. But it is a unique portion of European history characterized by a revolution in tactics, changing roles of people away from a feudal society becoming more irrelevant and a good backdrop for a number of large powers.

38	"Expanded [from an earlier answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5q3nsw/would_a_paleontologist_at_a_dig_in_1993_be/)  The public fascination with dinosaurs has existed for pretty much as long as the first fossilized specimens were discovered and displayed. One of the attractions of the mid-Victorian Crystal Palace exhibition were [now-apparent fanciful reconstructions](http://www.amusingplanet.com/2016/12/the-strange-victorian-dinosaurs-of.html) of *Iguanadon*s and other fantastic beasts. [Mary Anning](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/anning.html) made a living selling fossils and other discoveries to gentlemen-collectors, who subsequently wrote her out of the history of discovery even though she was an astute prospector for her era. The Carnegie-funded *Diplodocus* skeleton, affectionately nicknamed [Dippy](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/diplodocus-this-is-your-life.html) was not only a sensation for US museum-goers, but for the British public in the 1890s. The first *T. Rex* skeleton was a [massive draw](http://www.npr.org/2011/09/14/140410442/bone-to-pick-first-t-rex-skeleton-complete-at-last) and reflected the growing competition between museums to acquire the most dramatic and fierce specimens.   Dinosaurs naturally became a subject for the new media of film. Museums were increasingly trying to walk the line between static display and recreation of the creatures' past, and featured paintings like [Charles R. Knight's](http://research.amnh.org/paleontology/artwork/knight/) that provided a window into the past that was scientifically-accurate. Knight's paintings tended to hew towards reptilian sluggishness, which contemporaneous science held dinosaurs to be, but fiction was not beholden to science. Adventure novels like Arthur Conan Doyle's  *The Lost World* or Edgar Rice Burrough's *The Land That Time Forgot* created a world in which select groups of dinosaurs survived extinction on some lost island or hidden corner of the world. The 1925 film version of [*The Lost World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7vcKwmMzXA) featured stop-motion dinosaur action in both the titular lost world as well as in civilization when man mistakenly brings these creatures into the city. 1933's *King Kong* also featured a [dramatic fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEt_aYBZoTk) between a *T. Rex* and the giant ape. Although stop-motion dinosaurs did not make the initial transition to color film in the 1950s and 60s very well, dinosaurs remained a major element of popular culture. They were common components of Western childhood, and while some media drifted into ascientific monster genres (eg Godzilla- a mutated dinosaur), some of this media was didactic in purpose such as View-Master's [*The Little Yellow Dinosaur*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEfz7ALPx38) which detailed the travails of a hatchling dinosaur in the Cretaceous.   *The Little Yellow Dinosaur* may have been a minor element of American popular culture, but its descriptions of dinosaurs was part of a larger trend in paleontology changing perceptions of dinosaurs.  John Ostrom's work on *Deinonychus* in the 1960s, such as this [1969 paper](http://peabody.yale.edu/sites/default/files/documents/scientific-publications/ypmB30_1969.pdf) drew connections between the dromaeosaur and birds. This was part of a larger shift away in paleontology from seeing dinosaurs as lumbering reptiles and more dynamic. In the section ""Functional Significance of the Pes,"" Ostrom claimed:  &gt; Deinonychus must  have  been  anything  but  ""reptilian""  in  its  behavior,  responses  and  way  of  life.  It  must  have  been  a  fleet-footed,   highly   predaceous,  extremely  agile  and  very  active  animal,  sensitive  to  many  stimuli  and  quick  in  its  responses.  These  in  turn  indicate  an  unusual  level  of  activity  for   a  reptile  and  suggest  an  unusually  high  metabolic  rate.    Ostrom's student Robert Bakker would write a series of influential articles and letters in the 1970s for *Nature* such as [""Anatomical and Ecological Evidence of Endothermy in Dinosaurs""](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v238/n5359/abs/238081a0.html) and [""Dinosaur Monophyly and a New Class of Vertebrates""](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v248/n5444/abs/248168a0.html) that argued for endothermism and that dinosaurs were closer to birds. As Bakker put it in a 1975 *Scientific American* article [""Dinosaur Renaissance""](http://tuda.triumf.ca/evolution/articles/scientificamerican0475-58.pdf) which drew a clearer connection:  &gt;The evidence suggests, in fact,  that  the  dinosaurs  never  died  out completely.  One  group  still  lives.  We  call them birds.   Other young Turks of paleontology were also making this connection such as John Horner who found evidence of nesting behavior and other bird-like markers in correspondence to *Nature* such as [""Nest of juveniles provides evidence of family structure among dinosaurs""](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v282/n5736/abs/282296a0.html) and [""Evidence of colonial nesting and ‘site fidelity’ among ornithischian dinosaurs""](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v297/n5868/abs/297675a0.html). These ideas and the paleontologists associated with them filtered out into the wider public. *Harper's Magazine*, *Esquire*, *National Geographic*, and other popular magazines and newspapers did have periodic articles in the 1980s about the new ideas that overturned dinosaurs. One of the interesting ways to gauge how these notions of dinosaurs slowly made their way into the public is to look at the evolution of dinosaurs in Bill Waterson's popular syndicated comic strip [*Calvin and Hobbes*](http://www.gocomics.com/news/laugh-tracks/3976). Waterson's first dinosaurs resemble the lumbering reptiles that would not look out of place in the 1930s depictions of dinosaurs, but by 1988, his dinosaurs are the agile, avian-like speedsters of Bakker et al (and can even fly F-14s!).   Not surprisingly, Michael Crichton amalgamated much of Bakker and Horner for his character of Grant to depict a new breed of paleontologist who was not bounded by older stereotypes of dinosaurs. So while it arguably took Spielberg's film to make the *Velociraptor*  a household name, dinosaurs had not really went away in Western culture. Dinosaurs were a staple of fiction and a common feature in children's entertainment and educational materials. While the wider public may have been more illiterate with regards to the finer points of paleontology, the public's romance with dinosaurs has been a constant one that neither began in the 1990s nor ended with that decade."	human
39	During the Austro-Prussian war the Germans really went easy on Austria, Otto Von Bismark (Prime minister of Germany) was really a smart guy, he wanted to unify Germany but he also knew he had to have some friends so that if they got in a war they wouldn't be surrounded by all fronts so when they beat the Austrians they didn't do much to the Austrians but with France they already had a long history of feuds going back and forth with each other which is why they were so eager to go to war with each other. 	human

41	"The author is Calvin Martin and it's Chapter Four: ""Contact and Nature's Conspiracy"" of *Keepers of the Game: Indian-Animal Relationships and the Fur Trade*. Martin's an important figure in North American enviromental history / the economics of the fur trade, but this chapter in particular strikes me as  . . . I'll be charitable and say odd.  It makes a big leap from *one* Cree man's reported story of a legendary war on beavers to a continent wide urge on the part of native people to subdue defeat the wildlife.   Martin's work was really controversial, and his book spawned a whole new volume of essays: ""Indians, Animals, and the Fur Trade: A Critique of Calvin Martin's Keepers of the Game"" by Shepherd Krech, which then included a response from Martin to his critics.   The above has been pretty hard to write neutrally because I'm actually pretty upset by this, and on reflection, I think I'm completely right to be. The marginalization and ill-treatment of indigenous peoples is a real ongoing aspect of our society and in my opinion, Martin went about thoughtlessly fanning the flames of bigotry towards indigenous people. There has always been a strong popular sentiment that indigenous people are at fault for their own suffering, and need to stop ""whining"", and Martin's chapter reinforces that narrative.   If he honestly thought that he was reading the historical evidence correctly, and soberly weighed a lot of evidence for and against his theory, that'd be one thing. However, that's not what happened. In his response to his critics, Martin complained that they didn't understand that his book was ""an exercise of controlled imagination"" and refused to respond to their specific criticisms saying his book ""rang true"" to him. (This is all in the Shepherd Krech volume.)  I think that aside from what a horrible attitude this is in historical debate, such a sensitive area with potential real-life hurtful consequences for real people was not the place for unconstrained imagination exercises. Honestly, that should be common sense. But then this was the 70s, and apparently my idea of common sense wasn't common. "	human

43	EMT here.   After searching, I am unable to find a definitive source on what the poison actually was so this is a difficult question to answer. Some sources just refer to it as 'a pill', others claim it was an opiate, others claim that it was a specially formulated poison.   Current consensus seems to be that he died of a combination of stomach cancer and a stomach ulcer. While some drugs are known to increase likelihood of developing stomach ulcers, these tend to be NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin. Opiates often decrease gastric motility, causing constipation and in extreme circumstances bowel obstruction, but I can't find any literature linking opiates to ulcers. Even if we thought that Napoleon's overdose was of ibuprofen (unlikely since it wasn't invented until the 1950s), it would be unlikely to have caused an ulcer that led to his death, since ulcers are associated with long-term use of NSAIDs rather than a one-off overdose - overdoses of NSAIDs are more likely to cause liver damage than anything else. In addition ulcers caused by NSAIDs generally clear up fairly quickly after you stop taking them.   Risk factors for both peptic ulcers and stomach cancer include alcohol consumption, salty foods, smoked foods, and a diet low in fresh fruit and vegetables. It seems reasonable to assume that as Napoleon spent a lot of time at war, he probably consumed a lot of salted or smoked preserved foods, possibly had reduced access to fresh fruit and vegetables, and he is known to have enjoyed red wine.   It seems likely to me that diet and lifestyle factors were probably the biggest factors behind the cancer/ulcer combination that led to his death. However, since we don't actually know what he took in his suicide attempt, I don't think we are able to give a definite answer one way or the other. 	human

45	There are three main schools of thought when it comes to items regarding the Vietnam War.   The Orthodox school which largely encompasses general dove like sentiments about the war, usually written by veterans and journalist involved with the conflict itself. The Revisionist school which, although coming to prominence slightly after the conflict, has hawk like stances about the war. And a new emerging school that tends to not regard the stances of these two 'polarizing' schools as not disjoint or mutually exclusive but rather regards the Vietnam war as not being able to characterize the conflict and its proponents in either a good camp or bad camp. It also places the Vietnamese people as a more central player in the narrative that is the Vietnamese war ( this differs from the Orthodox and Revisionist schools that are in large part American soldiers, journalist, scholars, etc writing either during the conflict or in the years after).  Depending on which school the author subscribed to, by and large, reflected what view you'd receive from them on the matter. Orthodox scholars generally view Diem as autocratic and illegitimate. Despite the south being a 'democracy' many elections for positions in the government were rigged including Diem's own election in 1955. Diem had a tendency to appoint family members to prominent position in government, such as his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu as minister of interior; Nhu would play a large part in suppressing political dissent before and during Diem's rise to power. Nhu and his brother Ngo Dinh Thuc, the ArchBishop of Hue, would together play large roles in the suppressing Buddhism despite the large Buddhist presence in the South. Additionally, Diem would suppress public protests and newspapers (at times but never censoring the press entirely) (Some may have seen Diem as an American puppet, but I do not feel qualified enough to expand further on this topic).  In contrast to this, Revisionist scholars believe that Diem was justified in a lot of the actions he had taken in his rise to power as well as during his presidency. South Vietnam was in large part a 'new' country' in that the government was newly formed and in contrast to its traditional monarchical rule and colonial subjugation by France and Japan, had a lot of 'growing pains' in setting up this new government; additionally, as seen in other ex-colonies in Africa and other parts of South East Asia, prominent figures that use both wealth and force to attain political prominence are not uncommon and Diem is arguably one that comes to prominence with, a least publicly, a lesser tendency to use force. Additionally, the autocratic like tendencies of Diem have been attributed to the tough nature of Vietnam at the time, the South especially had a number of factions that vied for power such as Catholics, Buddhist, Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, as well as the fact that Diem has been the target of multiple assassination attempts over the course of his political career.  Vietnamese Centric scholars tend to not view these versions of Diem's legacies as exclusive to one another. However, notably in contrast to orthodox scholars, many view Diem, not as a American puppet, but rather made decisions on his own accord.  	human

49	As a predictive model, when did heliocentrism actually eclipse the geocentric model?  It has been my understanding that because Copernicus used circles rather than ellipses, his model was more prone to error when compared to the epicycle corrected Ptolemaic model. Would the greater accuracy of the latter, for then practical purposes, have influenced its acceptance among both the Jesuits and the Chinese?	human
50	Cheers  For a fascinating look into the history of the acceptance of the fact of Jupiter’s moons, check out *Galileo’s Telescope: A European Story* by Bucciantini, Camerota, and Guidice.  Cardinals and bishops and what not straight up at the eyepiece, looking at Jupiter, and convinced that the moons were tricks of glass “opticks”.  Granted the views weren’t as clear as what we enjoy today through even amateur telescopes, but it’s a fascinating look into the minds of men who just wouldn’t believe their own eyes.	human
51	It really depends what you consider to be predictive value; I would say that many of the unexpected predictions of the system, such as the phases of Venus and Jupiter's moons were extremely successful. But it also failed with some very obvious false predictions, such as the lack of observable parallax to the background stars, and the obvious fact that it doesn't 'feel' as if our planet is barrelling at a 1000km/h through the solar system.  If we restrict ourselves to merely the trajectories of planets, then I guess early heliocentric ideas weren't better than the alternatives. Tycho Brahe famously developed a hybrid geo-heliocentric theory - and he was unrivalled in Europe when it came to making accurate observations. Already with his pupil, Kepler, do we see a shift towards more sophisticated models of heliocentrism, with the introduction of some form of attractive forces, laws of nature, and as a result of all of this ecliptic trajectories.  But making more accurate trajectory calculations was not the primary upshot of heliocentrism. Mathematical simplicity was a major thing, but certainly heliocentrism had a philosophical allure as well among many renaissance figures, and ultimately the myriad of newly observed phenomena which conflicted with the Ptolemaic model were the deciding factor.	human

57	"&gt; Is 5 stars a cultural thing? Will rating things out of 6 stars (hotels, Just-Eat) ever take off?  Such 5-point rating systems is actually based on so called Likert-type scales, named after  Rensis Likert, who conceived it. Rensis Likert introduced what's today is known as Likert-type scale in order to capture quantitative or qualitative attributes in questionnaires for psychological research. That scale was defined as having the values/categories/levels of  ""Strongly disagree"" - ""Disagree"" - ""Neither agree nor disagree/Neutral"" - ""Agree"" - ""Strongly agree"".  There are other such rating scales that introduce more categories/levels  e.g. 7- or 10- point rating scales but the question whether these are better or not is a pure statistical question and depends on what the (statistical) question being answered is. For example 5- and 7- point rating scales result in general in higher mean/mode values when compared to 10-point rating scales (and that difference is statistical important) but do not have much difference when looking at the variance, skewness and/or kurtosis - again when compared against 10-point rating scales.

That doesn't seem right. The reference to Likert's scale I found on Wikipedia was to his 1932 article ""A Technique for the Measurement of Attitudes"", Archives of Psychology. He was born in 1903.  I find on Wikipedia a reference to an 1820 guidebook by Mariana Starke who wrote, ""... at the same time marking, with one or more exclamation points (according to their merit), those works which are deemed peculiarly excellent"". I also find a statement that ""Murray's Handbooks for Travellers and then the Baedeker Guides (starting in 1844) borrowed this system, using stars instead of exclamation points, first for points of interest, and later for hotels"".  It's more likely that Likert took his inspiration from all the guides floating around."	human
60	&gt;The Chinese, on the other hand, couldn't give a shit about theory. Their astronomy was primarily and almost exclusively focused on making accurate observations, without worrying too much about whether or not the observed phenomena were compatible with cosmological beliefs.  To clarify, it wasn't that the Chinese didn't care about theory. As I elaborated on in my reply to the OP, Chinese philosophers such as Zhu Xi articulated cosmological theories based on pre-scientific ideas such as the Five Phases or yin and yang. Chinese *astronomers* did ignore the philosophical cosmologies of the Neo-Confucians or Taoists, but this is due to the segregation between philosophy and astronomy. To reproduce a quote by astronomer Wang Xishan (1628-1682):  &gt;When it came to the Sung period, astronomy bifurcated; there was one astronomy for scholars and another for astronomers. The scholars did not know astronomical mathematics, and so they depended upon empty principles in establishing their theories. The technicians did not apprehend the principles of astronomy, but merely settled upon techniques that managed to predict the phenomena.  This segregation between different domains of knowledge can be seen in other areas of Chinese science. Chinese cartographers would depict the Earth as flat up until the arrival of the Jesuits, while Chinese astronomers had long been performing calculations seemingly under the assumption of a spherical Earth. While we can speak of many Chinese science*s*, there was no concept of a singular, unified Chinese science that integrated different areas of scientific inquiry. To quote Nathan Sivin:  &gt;One aspect was that there does not seem to have been a systematic connection between all the sciences in the minds of the people who did them. They were not integrated under the dominion of philosophy, as schools and universities integrated them in Europe and Islam. They had sciences but no science, no single conception or word for the overarching sum of all of them.	human
61	"18th and 19th century Anglo-Americans did come up with some outlandish theories about the origins of Native Americans.  Part of this stemmed from the widespread, prejudiced view that non-white people were intellectually and culturally inferior to Europeans and therefore could not have built the great civilizations that European colonizers encountered in the New World.  In North America, ancient Native American structures often took the form of burial mounds.  Prior to the 20th century, the majority of scholars (with Thomas Jefferson an interesting exception) claimed that these ""Mound Builders"" were the descendants of seafaring ancient peoples such as the Vikings, Greeks, Phoenicians, or perhaps one of the ""Lost Tribes of Israel.""  (This last theory was favored by early Mormons.)  For example, in an 1885 paper titled ""Among the Mound Builders' Remains,"" Historical and Scientific Society of Manitoba president George Bryce wrote that the Aztecs told the Spanish conquistadors that:  ""... before they invaded Mexico from their original home, they were preceded by a civilized race, well acquainted with the arts and science, knowing more art and astronomy in particular than they. They stated that they had exterminated this race."" http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17987/17987-h/17987-h.htm  Some of the members of Lewis and Clark's expedition (1804-1806) across the Louisiana Purchase territories to the Pacific Ocean encountered Indian tribes whom they believed were descendants from Europeans or Israelites.    The idea that certain lighter-skinned or blue-eyed tribes along the Missouri River were descendants of the Welsh were particularly popular during this period.  From a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Meriwether Lewis in 1804:  ""I inclosed you the map of a Mr. Evans, a Welshman, employed by the Spanish government for that purpose, but whose original object I believe had been to go in search of the Welsh Indians, said to be up the Missouri."" http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00033  Joseph Whitehouse, one of the expedition members, wrote in his journal about a certain tribe: ""we take these savages to be the Welch [Welsh] Indians"" https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1805-09-06#ln22090608  When another expedition member, John Ordway, described Indians with ""the Stranges [sic] language of any we have ever yet Seen,"" he likewise concluded: ""we think perhaps that they are the welch Indians."" https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1805-09-05#lc.jrn.1805-09-05.01  TL;DR White Americans had a lot of strange theories about Native Americans, based on no evidence but the common idea that non-white people were intellectually inferior to whites.

62	Matteo Ricci, in what you say, is claiming that the Chinese believed that the Earth was flat. Was this, overall, accurate? Or was it due to a miscommunication or something like that? Both in the West (the Greeks) and in the Levant (Biblical verses describing it as round). It seems surprising to me that a civilization as advanced as China, that had a decent amount of use of boats (where it is most obvious as there is no terrain in the way of seeing that the bottom disappears first) would think that the Earth is flat.	human
63	 Per [Russian Statistical Service report on WWII, page 31](http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2015/vov_svod.pdf), the pre-war populations of areas occupied up until December 1941 was 74 million, or roughly 40% of the total pre-war population of USSR (this gives census population of un-occupied territories of roughly 116 million, but out of this number several million would be in areas like Leningrad that were blockaded, but unoccupied). The pre-war population of German Reich was roughly 79 million.   As a result, I think that it's safe to say that operation Barbarossa was successful in eliminating Soviet population advantage in purely German/Soviet context, but not enough in the bigger context of war.	human

65	Up until the 19th century, the aristocracy around Europe were being served “à la Française”, which was very much like a buffet. A number of dishes was served at the same time on a table, and the guests would pick from them while standing.    Originally there was no particular order, but gradually dinners would follow a sequence that would begin with soups and fish, followed by roasted pieces, and ending with desserts. The aim was to impress by presenting as many dishes as possible, in the most artful way as possible.    However, more often than not the dishes were cold or would turn cold by the time guests would get to them. This was probably a rather uncritical detail in southern Europe, but probably more inconvenient in the dead of Russian winter.    That’s probably one of the reasons why in Russia dishes would rather be served individually to each guest seated around the table. But that’s not the only thing that would irk a Russian visitor.    The Russian playwright Denis Fonvizin wrote in a letter to his sister in 1778: *“French cuisine is excellent, you have to do it justice, but service is detestable. […] I would often leave table still starving whenever I have dinner in town. I would sit in front of a dish I don’t like and wouldn’t eat from, and I’m too nearsighted to see what’s at the other end of the table. The Russian way of serving dishes around the table is more rational.”*   Thirty-odd years later, Alexander Kurakin, the Russian ambassador to Napoleon’s court, famously introduced dinner in the style of the Russian aristocracy whereby seated guests would be served individually and in sequence, ideally by one waiter each and at the same time in a kind of choreography.    So the impressive part shifts from the dishes, their amount, quality, and presentation to the way they are being served. In other words, you could serve less but in a spectacular way, which keeps the guest happy. Waiters coming around to your table with an impressive roast piece on a trolley, and slicing smaller portions for you is something inherited in a straight line from ambassador Kurakin’s dinner parties. This is taught as “service au guéridon” (side table service) in catering schools today.    French restaurants gradually adopted the “service à la Russe”, mostly because it presented the great advantage of making the cooks job easier since it allowed them to prepare dishes in sequence instead of way in advance. And this change had a great impact on the logistics of catering and even home dining as we know it today.     Among other things, it led to the emergence of menus in restaurants, which was previously unnecessary since the contents of the menu were literally all right there on the table. And thanks to these menus, we know what people were eating in restaurants from the 19th century on, ranging from a 3-4 course menu to 10, 20, or 30-course banquet.     Sources:    *The Dining Nobility: From the Burgundian Dukes to the Belgian Royalty*, by Patrick Rambourg    *À table… le menu!*, by Patrick Rambourg    *Letters from France*, Denis Fonvizin    *Tables d’Hier, Tables d’Ailleurs*, by JL Flandrin    *À table au XIXe siècle*, collective.   	human
66	"I will start this response by immediately telling you that unfortunately - and quite possibly one of my main reasons for loving early medieval Scotland - there aren't very many sources still around about much of early medieval Scotland this including the Briton's of Strathclyde. Early Medieval Scotland likely did have some monastic chronicles from this time period as we see glimpses of these appearing in later sources but these originals no longer exist.   From what we know the Briton's of Strathclyde were a celtic people who held sway in South-west Scotland and parts of North West England - particularly in Cumbria which is why they are sometimes refered to as Cumbrian - and existed on and off as an independent entity from around the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions in the 5th century until their eventual assimilation with the Scottish Kingdom sometime in the 11th century - possibly the 12th century I really can't stress enough how little information we have about Scotland at this time. They are the remnants of the celtic peoples who had inhabited that part of Britain since before the Roman Invasions and likely spoke a language in the same branch of Celtic Languages as Welsh and Breton known as ""Cumbric"".  Therefore they differ from the many people around them such as the Picts to their North East - natives to Britain but distinct enough that we wouldn't class them as Britons -, the Scots to their North-West in Argyll - Gaelic settlers from Northern Ireland -, and the Anglo-Saxon people of Lothian to their South-East and East - who had invaded and displaced the pre-existing Britons of the lands that they settled and can almost be seen as a last bastion of Brythonic culture in the North of Briton.    There are also traces of Gaelic peoples in the very very South-Western parts of Scotland but even less is known about them and their existence is debated heavily possibly being pre-viking but most likely being the colonisation by Norse-Gaels after the Vikings.   So once we get to the beginning of the Viking age in the late 8th early 9th century we see an fairly autonomous people located in the South-West and North-West of Scotland and England. "	human

We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.   It is crazy that they cant see the hypocrisy in this. I guess it shows that slaves were quite literally seen as sub human, maybe even sub animal."	human
69	During the Soviet occupation, one of the first things they did was to eliminate any chance of resistance to their occupation. The NKVD already had a large number of Polish Army officers and enlisted  in prisoner camps, and to these numbers added university professors, lawyers, police officers, priests, politicians, essentially anyone who could become the focal point of resistance or who could inspire others to resist.  Some were just “capitalists” such as factory owners, but the majority was part of the social and civil fabric and could become potential sources of resistance. The NKVD at one point had approximately 500,000 Poles in prison camps in Poland. The NKVD proceeded to liquidate the most troublesome @22,000m of which 14,000 were captured military or police officers. Enlisted soldiers in many instances were shipped to Siberia to provide labor gangs.  The executed were then collected and buried in several mass graves in the Katyn Forrest.   These graves would remain hidden until the Germans overran the area during their invasion eastward. There are another estimated 130,000 executed by the Soviets during the occupation, on top of the Katyn incident.  The Katyn incident is the most notorious.  The Soviets justified in that Poland was never a country, just merely a rebellious extension of Belarus and Ukraine, so captured Polish army members were not afforded the rights of POWs and were simply criminals.  Initially the occupation was resented by Poles, but welcomed by ethnic Ukrainians and other minorities within the Polish boundaries. This ended quickly as it became clear the Soviets were not going to allow these groups any measure of self-determination, and would be suppressed like the Poles.  The Soviets begain a process of de-Polandizing Poland. Disbanded the government, replaced the currency, the Soviets also engaged in widespread looting of Polish industry, shipping the machinery east, as well as plundering Polish national treasures, as well as petty looting of the populace. No public organizations were allowed to exist,  the university and the school system had any elements of Polish culture stripped from them and were reorganized to be Soviet institutions.  Sexual violence by Soviet troops appears to also have reached epidemic levels among Polish women, but historians have had only scattered and fragmented accounts and cannot accurately place a number, or even really give an accurate guess on the number of victims. (The Red Army would repeat this during their return to Poland as they drove West into Germany years later.)   The Soviets began mass deportations in several cities, as well as deporting those arrested and convicted of anti-revolutionary activity or crimes against the Soviet Union. Roughly a million or so Poles were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan. The land was reorganized according to Soviet guidelines and collectivized, as were all remaining industries.  Basically, the Soviets were doing everything possible to annex and integrate the captured territory into the Soviet Union.  *Between Nazis and Soviets* -   Jan Chodakiewicz  *Katyn* – Paul Allen  *Poland's Holocaust* -  Tadeusz Piotrowski	human
70	" Two of the most famous Tolstoy novels - ""War and Peace"" and ""Anna Karenina"" - depict very upper crust Russians who typically were either home-schooled or received private education; the third one, ""Resurrection"", still features a lot of characters with similar upbringing.    Tolstoy himself belonged to Russian elite, and there is a general consensus that the way the dialogues are worded in Russian are similar to how the said elite would talk; however, this would be very different from how lower classes talked, and it is generally accepted that other writers captured the peculiarities of commoners' language better, even if the way Tolstoy's ""commoner"" characters speak is perfectly fine."	human

79	"No one ever asked if Barbarossa was inherently impossible. If anything, the Invasion of France had looked even more hopeless initially, yet it ended up being a stunning success. There were even more reasons to be optimistic about their chances in the East than there had been with France, due to Stalin's purges of the Army's officers, slow progress on expanding Russia's industrial capabilities, and serious unrest of various ethnic groups within the country.  So the idea that an invasion of the Soviet Union was ""innately flawed"" wasn't really a perspective that the Nazi leadership even entertained. Conflict with Stalin was viewed as inevitable. The question was simply ""what is the best time to strike""? Should a strike against the Soviets should be launched in 1941, or would delaying a year would improve the German's chances? With Allied airstrikes degrading German industrial capacity by the day, and Hitler having run out of targets for easy expansion as the invasion of Yugoslavia was wrapping up, they decided on 1941, rather than giving Stalin an additional year to prepare."	human
80	"It’s counter-intuitive, but historians would actually stress the lack of surprise. The popular narrative is that Japan was closed to the outside world until Perry forced the country wide open, and the outside world poured in immediately. This really isn’t the case. A lot more knowledge and materials flowed into Edo Period Japan than people usually imagine. Furthermore, the process of fully opening the country to foreigners took place over a period of fourteen years following the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. What you knew about the outside world and modern science before Perry’s arrival, what you learned after, and what shocked you would depend completely on your status and geographical location.  Quoting myself from an [earlier post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6jc73k/during_the_sakoku_were_there_instances_of/):   &gt;Westerners today largely know about the small Dutch trading post of Dejima at Nagasaki, but Chinese traders were also welcome and very numerous in the port of Nagasaki, where they had a large quarter of the city. Korean trade took place at the island of Tsuushima which is halfway between Japan and Korea on the shortest route between the two countries. In the north, the Matsumae clan handled trade with the Ainu on the frontier of Japanese control. And, last but not least, the Ryukyu Kingdom (today's Okinawa) was officially an independent vassal state to both Japan and China. In practice, the Ryukyu Kingdom was under the domination of Japan's Satsuma domain, and Satsuma traded with China through the polite fiction of the Ryukyu Kingdom doing the trading.  Through the Dutch and Chinese contacts, in particular, lots of scientific and political information entered Japan. As an example, [Japanese scholars by the time of Perry were very aware of the science of electricity](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6lufvn/what_knowledge_of_electricity_did_japan_gain_from/), carrying out their own experiments. The effect of Japan being “closed”, though, was that there was certainly a delay in new technology and science entering the country. Japanese 19th century scholars were completely aware of that delay, and that Western technology, science, military strategies, and geographic knowledge had pulled far ahead of Japanese knowledge, and were impatient to learn more, and afraid of Western power.   MIT’s Visualizing Cultures website has a great illustrated essay: [The Opium War in Japanese Eyes]( https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027/opium_wars_japan/oje_essay01.html) on an 1849 Japanese book on the Western powers’ treatment of China, which includes sketches of steamships. The book, with its fearful concern for Japan’s strength, was censored by the shogunate, but widely circulated nonetheless among scholars. Other less-censored books on the history and geography of the world were also published in the first half of the eighteenth century. The ordinary populace knew much less, of course. Their introduction to Western ways and technology would be a series of surprises, but gradually, over a long period. The treaty of Kanagawa, only opened trading at two ports: Shimoda and Hakodate, and it wasn’t until 1868 that the new Meiji government committed to completely opening Japan to foreigners. During the interval, the foreign foothold in Japan gradually increased. There was no one moment where every new thing came flooding in.   Knowing there was a gap in technology was one thing. Seeing was really believing. Actually seeing the Black Ships steam into Edo Bay shook people who already knew of their existence, as well as the ordinary people who had only the vaguest idea. The most shocked and surprised Japanese observers soon after the Convention of Kanagawa were the lucky few who were sent abroad and could take in the *scale* of Western advances in technology.   The 1860 mission to the United States was the first Japanese mission overseas in centuries, and its members were completely blown away by what they saw (though not always culturally or morally approving.) There’s a very good, readable book about their experience: [“As We Saw Them: The First Japanese Embassy to the United States”]( https://books.google.ca/books?id=SvCPmEMAScQC) by Masao Miyoshi.  Fukuzawa Yukichi, one of the mission members, recalled many years later:  &gt;Then we were taken to a hotel. All the floors were covered by carpets—the kind of fabric the richest Japanese splurged on, spending a fortune for square inches so a wallet or pouch could be made. The fabric was spread all over the floor in these huge rooms. And people stepped on them in their street shoes. They didn't change their shoes, so we didn't take off our *zori* either. At once we were served drinks. When a bottle was opened, it exploded with a frightening noise. The strange drink was champagne. There was something floating in our glasses. Of course we didn't know they could have ice in such warm spring weather. Those glasses standing in a row before us, and we trying to drink it up! Some were frightened by the floating objects and spat them out; some were loudly crunching on the cubes. It took us some time before we all realized it was ice. We wanted to smoke. There were no tobacco trays [*tabako bon*], nor ash trays [*hai fuki*]. I lit my pipe from the fire in the stove. I suppose there were matches on the table, but we didn't know what they were. Well, I lit my pipe, but finding no tray to put the ashes in, I pulled out tissue paper from my breast pocket, emptied the ashes into it, and crushing the fire out care-fully and twisting the paper into a ball, I put it back into my pocket. I was trying to have another puff, when smoke began to rise from my kimono sleeve. My God! the fire wasn't out, and it was spreading to the pocket!"" (p. 33, *As We Saw Them*)  If this tale interests/amuses you, there is plenty more of these stories in this book, and similar tales of encountering the unknown in other books about the first Japanese visitors to Europe and America.

81	 Do as you wish, but, broadly speaking, Soviet sources claim that by 1942 as a result of Barbarossa USSR lost its manpower superiority - a view shared by Stalin in his 1942 orders, and in Zhukov in his memoirs - and the memoirs of Germans mostly contain opinion that Soviets did have the said superiority, which was, in turn, shared by a considerable amount of Western scholars. Both sources are biased, as Soviets tried to boost their case for heroic victory for propaganda purposes, but, similarly, Germans were often overestimating the opponents to make excuses for their own losses, and Soviets generally had much better access to Soviet archives. It's a hotly debated topic, even more so given the Russia's recent turn towards glorification of Stalinism.   Unless you want to start a cite war where half of the sources would be in a language that most people here can't understand, I suggest that you realize that the least worst answer can sometimes boil to a single number from which people can draw their own conclusions.	human
82	"I will start this response by immediately telling you that unfortunately - and quite possibly one of my main reasons for loving early medieval Scotland - there aren't very many sources still around about much of early medieval Scotland this including the Briton's of Strathclyde. Early Medieval Scotland likely did have some monastic chronicles from this time period as we see glimpses of these appearing in later sources but these originals no longer exist.   From what we know the Briton's of Strathclyde - also known as Alt Clut - were a celtic people who held sway in South-west Scotland and parts of North West England - particularly in Cumbria which is why they are sometimes refered to as Cumbrian - and existed on and off as an independent entity from around the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions in the 5th century until their eventual assimilation with the Scottish Kingdom sometime in the 11th century - possibly the 12th century I really can't stress enough how little information we have about Scotland at this time. They are the remnants of the celtic peoples who had inhabited that part of Britain since before the Roman Invasions and likely spoke a language in the same branch of Celtic Languages as Welsh and Breton known as Cumbric.  Therefore they differ from the many people around them such as the Picts to their North East - natives to Britain but distinct enough that we wouldn't class them as Britons -, the Scots to their North-West in Argyll - Gaelic settlers from Northern Ireland -, and the Anglo-Saxon people of Lothian to their South-East and East - who had invaded and displaced the pre-existing Britons of the lands that they settled and can almost be seen as a last bastion of Brythonic culture in the North of Briton.    There are also traces of Gaelic peoples in the very very South-Western parts of Scotland but even less is known about them and their existence is debated heavily possibly being pre-viking but most likely being the colonisation by Norse-Gaels after the Vikings.   So once we get to the beginning of the Viking age in the late 8th early 9th century we see an fairly autonomous people located in the South-West and North-West of Scotland and England. To address your questions directly, No the Britons were not related to the Vikings. However, South-West Scotland did see extensive interaction with Norse and Danish peoples and a little bit of colonisation.   Were they remnants of Rome?  No the Britons were the native Celtic people of Britain and are descended from the Celtic people that had come under the control of Rome after their invasion and were liberated after Romes withdrawal from Britain.  Did the Briton of Strathclyde found wales? No while the peoples of Wales were also Britons they were also distinct, speaking a different albeit similar language. Wales was also a very fragmented country split between a number of different British warlords and tribes along with a number of Anglo-Saxon incursions.  Throughout the time between the Viking age and the 12th century Strathclyde would be dominated by its neighbours, throughout the 9th century the Picts would dominate Strathclyde and while Strathclyde would see much more independence at times the Pictish and later Scottish kingdoms would dominate it.  After the reign and defeat  Fergus of Galloway in 1161 the limited evidence we have appears to show us that the Kingdom is absorbed by the growing Kingdom of Alba and the Britons of Strathclyde disappears. To such an extent that by the 12th century the language of the Britons becomes extinct - although this is likely a process that had started many decades before with Scottish influence and culture appearing to dominate the British nobility and culture of the region.  Strathclyde did however retain some distinct characteristics as it has been argued that the title of ""Lord of Galloway"" possibly acted in a similar manner to the English ""Prince of Wales"".   _________________________________________________________________________________________________________   On to books, I will be listing my sources for this information as part of standard /r/AskHistorians rules anyway and I recommend all of those texts but will highlight a few and talk about the problems with others.  _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I highly recommend the first three books in the current edition of the New Edinburgh History of Scotland Series:  ""From Caledonia to Pictland, Scotland to 795"" by James E. Fraser  ""From Pictland to Alba, 789 - 1070"" by Alex Woolf  ""Dominion and Lordship Scotland 1070 - 1230"" by Richard Oram  These are an excellent series of books for giving a good grounding on Early Medieval Scottish History. They are more general readings but these Historians have all done fantastic work in their field. I would personally recommend Woolf who pioneering research about 10 years ago flipped perceptions about Pictland and in particular the power base of the Kingdom being in the North of Scotland and not in the Firth of Tay. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________  ""Early Sources of Scottish History - Volume 1 and 2"" by Alan O. Anderson  Anderson's work is extensive and is a blessing. His two volumes are English translations of most of the early sources that deal with Scotland in the Early medieval setting. However, the biggest thing to recognise with Anderson's work is that these books were published in 1908. This means that many of Anderson's comments and observations are no longer recognised by Historian's as correct - a good example is the assumption that the Pictish Kingdom of Fortriu being based in the Tay, partly based on racist assumptions about the Highlands of Scotland - which as we know from Woolf's work in recent years is no longer completely accepted. Furthermore there are much more modern translations of some of these sources around - these transaltions unfortunately often locked into academic papers that you have to pay for to access. However, Anderson's volumes are broad and have almost all the sources translated into English. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Full List of Sources:  ""Dominion and Lordship Scotland 1070 - 1230"" by Richard Oram  ""Early Sources of Scottish History - Volume 1 and 2"" by Alan O.

84	16th-17th centuries.  It's pretty much the gap between Medieval II and Empire TW.  This was a very turbulent time in history thanks to the Reformation and Counter-Reformation which caused many brutal relgious wars such as the French Religous war, Thirty Years War and War of the Three Kingdoms.   It also saw great upheavals in the balance if power on the continent with the rise of England, Dutch and French with the decline of the HRE, Italian states and Iberian peninsula.   Military tactics of the era relied on the use of pike, shot, cannon and cavalry. Pikes keep the cavalry away from the musketeers, cannon wreck the pike formations, and cavalry can wreck the musketeers or cannon so long as the pikemen arent around. Its an interesting rock paper scissors. There was quite a lot of cavalry fighting.   Its a similar time period as Shogun 2. You get the transition from Medieval to Early Modern warfare.	human

86	"Hey I will try to take a stab at this, though I am only a 4th year undergrad student. You seem to be viewing the mandate of heaven as similar to divine authority. They are not the same. While in Europe as seen with the Reformation, anything that questioned the total authority of Christianity questioned the authority of the king and had to be shut down. The mandate of heaven did not work in this same way. What the mandate of heaven was can perhaps be equated to Rousseau's social contract. The ruler was a ruler because he was fit to be the ruler he was not the head of a religious institution. China has a history of religious diversity in their religions being more ideological and based on respect not entirely on a god that passed on power to the ruler. The mandate of heaven comes from heaven which is not fully an entity but more a force and any who subscribe to that force theoretically are just and can rule. So having Islam or Buddhism within the country presented no problem to authority and was tolerated for that.   An interesting side not is that China had a tendency to be for fairly tolerant in the Ming dynasty. When the printing press made its way to China under Ming rule jnstead of shutting down shops and burning books like their European counter parts what the Ming did was enforce a reading list. Instead of making it illegal to read certain books they made it so many people who read/bought books had to have a few certain ones. I forget which ones but Timothy Brook in his book ""Confusians of Pleasure: Culture and Commerce in Ming China"" describes this period quite well."	human
87	"I think it is a kind of ""king of sacrifices"" that is, the highest sacrifice one can do is one's own child, all his life there is to be, all that could be, puff, gone. So the Greeks speak of a sacrifice to a determined god, sometimes said to be Chronos and others Poseidon (I think Poseidon got mentioned once in these kind of offerings) but they are, essentially, to one deity, as far as I knew... though given that there were various gods and the Israeli god did not forbid the sacrifice, but did forbid it *in the name of other*, well, then that might be a clue. On the other hand, that god is called Molech, so there is that. It's quite confusing, but I think if one applies flexibility one could reach the root of the matter, admitting that maybe there is a wordplay between MLK and MLCh. Although I should not be doing these assumptions since I am no professional, but I want to raise the question."	human

91	"Emphasis on *should*, in my opinion. It was a thing taught in classes as the ""right way"" to present oneself.   I imagine the quote marks are important, though - American culture has as long a legacy of people ignoring what ""should"" be done as it has of defining right and wrong ways to do it.   Like, although I'm not thinking of any specific examples, I can't imagine Mark Twain being on board with the idea of elocution as ""right"" and informal speech as ""wrong."" *Innocents Abroad* roughly contemporaneous with the rise of elocution textbooks in America's elementary-school classrooms, and something as dialect-oriented as *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer* seems to me like it would give fans of the *McGuffey Reader* the collywobbles.   Actually, I suppose someone with the right resources could probably compare how well McGuffey sold compared with Tom Sawyer in the early 20th century, which might imply something about public attitudes toward formal speech versus dialect.

92	"​  &gt; Does the equinox mean what we call the equator?    It's not a synonym, but closely connected. I should have probably used ""equator"" here to be clearer. An equinox describes the moment when the plane of Earth's equator passes through the center of the Sun's disk,  occuring twice per year around 20th of March and 23rd of September. So it is the point in which the center of the visible sun is directly over the equator - Acosta mentions the  ""Equinoctiall Line "" in this sense.  &gt; It seems surprising that this was only discovered in the 16th century. Hadn't southern Africa been explored before?  I'm gonna do the lame thing of quoting myself again from another answer in the thread linked above:   &gt; ... these regions [ie. India and SE Asia] would have been in Temperate Zone and are above the equator. Acosta says as much, and points to knowledge of the Torrid Zone increasing only with the Portuguese circumnavigation of the Cape of Good Hope (in the slightly more antiquated translation by Edward Grimeston from 1880, p. 27):  &gt;&gt; And truely in this point wee must pardon Aristotle, seeing that in his time they had not discovered beyond the first Ethiopia, called the exterior ; ioyning to Arabia and Africke ; the other Ethiopia being wholy unknowne in his age. Yea, all that great Land which we now call the Land of Prete Ian [Prester John], neyther had they any knowledge of the rest that lyes under the Equinoctiall, and runnes beyond the Tropicke of Capricorne unto the Cape of Good Hope, so famous and well knowne by the navigation of Portugals...  So while Europeans had been to more northern parts of Africa before, the first European circumnavigation of the Cape of Good Hope was only under Bartholomeu Dias in 1488. I would imagina that cartographing such more southern African regions, not to mention writing about and analysing their climate, would already take us some way into the 16th century. Add to this that manuscripts did not travel quite as fast yet at that time over large distances; and that the union of Crowns between Portugal and Spain came only in the 1560s, increasing knowledge exchange between both realms.   Someone else in that thread linked to this [image of the tropic of cancer](https://imgur.com/3iBheA0), which shows quite nicely how many regions that European travelers were more familiar with in the middle ages are actually to the north of it.   &gt; People knew that the Earth was round since ancient times, and they ""knew"" that the Sun goes around different orbits at different times of the year. Couldn't they have figured out that the seasons would be different in the southern hemisphere?   I don't know enough about natural sciences to get into the scientific part of this. However, it's always difficult to assume that something that seems natural to us would have been so for people in, say the middle ages. A few things to keep in mind here: 1) I mentioned Aristotle above, who was still known simlply as ""the philosopher"" in many medieval and early modern writings because of his central standing. Many writings by Aristotle and other classical thinkers had only been brought ""back"" to Europe via the crusades in medieval times. This means that temporaly speaking they were seen as quite ""recent"" still during the beginning of early modernity, which only added to their importance. (This also makes clearer why Acosta would continue to go back to Aristotle, Plato and others throughout his Historia).  2) The other main authority for Europeans in the middle ages was the Catholic church, with the bible as ""the book"" (analogous to Aristotle as the philosopher). So to assume a mindset that does not take into account Christian cosmology for those questions you're asking is to misunderstand late mideaval/early modern ways of conveiving the world.  There's a reason why debates over the heliocentric world-view were fought over so fiercely by the church into the 17th c. at least, and it much had to do with the church defending a primacy over knowledge of how the world and cosmos work (in a religious sense).  So in order not to ramble on, I'd highlight that to mentalities in pre/early modern Europe, these authorities of the church and the classical canon continued to be highly influential. Anthony Grafton's ""new worlds ancient texts"" is a great book on this. I'd also add that without knowing important parts of the Southern hemisphere (e.g. southern Africa, see above; the Americas) it would have been that much harder to figure out the difference in seasons there."	human

94	Pretty much the same way they treated them when they occupied them between 1939-41. The PPR was a puppet state in its early years, so there was no impact to relations. You have to remember there was an active armed resistence (the infamous Cursed Soldiers) to the Soviets in Poland for about two years '44-'46 before the Sovs stomped it out. It was what amounted to a civil war, so those who sided with the Soviets really just ignored what had happened in the past so they could be put into positions of power by the Soviets, and kept there. In later years the Soviets would simply tell the Poles to stop complaining about what happened because they should be thankful the USSR saved them from the Nazis, and besides it was all Stalins fault, so you really can't blame us because we are good Communists, Stalin was a bad Communist.

From [an older post on the death toll of the Holocaust](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/76avmk/how_do_we_estimate_the_number_of_jewish_deaths_in/):  **Part 1**  Newer scholarship estimates on the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust range somewhere in between 5.4 million people and 6.2 million people. This has to do with a problem in evidence. Despite the stereotype of the Nazis being super bureaucratic and writing everything down, they did in fact not keep an exact tally, especially where shootings and the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard as well as the non-Reinhard camp of Chelmno was concerned. Furthermore, the Nazis did indeed try to hide what they were doing, with which I deal [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3nd4dy/how_did_the_nazis_try_to_hide_what_had_happened/).  In order to arrive at the total figured, the methods historians' use is combining direct estimates, i.e. the number of victims in concentration camps, extermination camps, through killing squads plus all additional material about killed people, with methods of indirect statistical comparison, i.e. population statistics before and after the war. By combining the two methods and looking for a convergence of evidence on one range of figures versus another, we can estimate figures with a high degree of confidence. Given the lack of complete population statistics this number still has a margin of error (that's the reason for the range between 5.4 and 6.2 million) but not a margin of error so large that 6 million suddenly become 3 million or just hundred thousand.  Let me show you how this works:  One key source is the so-called [Korherr Report](http://www.ns-archiv.de/verfolgung/korherr/korherr-lang.php). Richard Korherr was the head of the SS statistics bureau and in March 1943 he compiled a report about the decrease in Jewish population in Europe from 1932 to December 1942. He arrives at the conclusion that through normal decrease due to the death rate, due to emigration and due to German policy, the number of Jews in Europe has decreased about 4 million from 32 to 42. With regards to about 1.2 million Jews, he uses the phrase ""Es wurden durchgeschleust durch die Lager im Generalgouvernement"" (Guided through the camps in the General Government), which was what Himmler suggested he use instead of ""Sonderbehandlung"" (special treatment). This is Nazi code language for killed. So we know that by December 42, the head of the SS office for statistics gives a number of killed Jews that is 1.2 million.  However, several things need to be looked at in addition to the number Korherr gives here. First of all, the number of 1.2 million Korherr gives here seems to be correct in relation to the Operation Reinhard extermination camps. We can verify this number using the Höfle Telegram. The Höfle Telegram is an intercept from British intelligence. Sent originally on January 11, 1943 by Hermann Höfle, who was Odilo Globocnik's deputy in Operation Reinhard - the killing of the Jews of the General Government in the camps of Sobibor, Treblinka, and Belzec - it details the number of Jews that have arrived at the Operation Reinhard Camp by January 1943 and it also arrives at a total number of 1.2 million. So, using the Korherr Report with back up from the Höfle Telegram, we can assert with certainty that by January 1943, 1.2 million Jews had been killed in the Operation Reinhard Camps.   From the Korherr Report it is also possible to assert that Korherr did not have the Einsatzgruppen numbers. This comes from the Korherr Report itself where Korherr writes that he didn't count the Jews in Russia and on the frontline. The Einsatzgruppen reports are available to us. From June 1941 on, the Einsatzgruppen send detailed reports about their activities in the Soviet Union to Himmler and various other agencies. From those we can assert that by late 1941 the Einsatzgruppen killed at least 500.000 Jews in the Soviet Union. With the second round of killing that is less well documented, the total number of victims of the Einsatzgruppen by 43 comes through a variety of sources to about 1.5 million people. That combined with the numbers we have from Korherr shows that by mid-43 3 million Jews were already dead. And that does not account for the Jews killed in Auschwitz, the Jews killed in Poland during the operations in 1939, the Jews of Serbia being killed by the Wehrmacht and by gas van, the Aktion Harvest Festival in the Majdanek camp, the killing of the Hungarian Jews in 1944 and so on.  Now, talking about Auschwitz:  Here we take a look at Robert Jan van Pelt in his [report for the Irving v. Lipstadt trial](https://www.hdot.org/vanpelt/#vanPelt_1).  Starting with countries where the numbers can be established relatively straightforward through archival documentation, it starts as follows:  * France: 71 transports between March 27, 1944 and August 22, 1944; transport lists total to a number of some 69,000 deportees.  * The Netherlands: 68 transports between July 15, 1942 and September 3, 1944; transport lists total to a number of 60,000 deportees.  * Greece: 22 transports between March 20, 1943 and August 16, 1944; railway tickets show the deportation of some 49,000 Jews from Saloniki to Auschwitz, and transport lists show the deportation of another 6,000 Jews from Athens and Corfu to Auschwitz.  * Bohemia and Moravia: 24 transports between October 26, 1942 and October 1944; transport lists total a number of some 46,000 deportees.  * Slovakia: 19 transports between March 26, 1942 and October 20, 1942; various other transports in the fall of 1944; transport lists total a number of some 27,000 deportees;  * Belgium: 27 transports between August 4, 1942 and July 31, 1944; transport lists total a number of some 25,000 deportees;  * Italy: 13 transports between October 18, 1943 and October 24, 1944; transport lists total a number of some 7,500 deportees;  * Norway: 2 transports between December 1, 1942 and February 2, 1943; transport lists total a number of 700 deportees.   Which brings us to a **sub-total of some 290,000 deportees** based on relatively straightforward archival information. These deportees were either killed on arrival, and therefore not registered, or admitted to the camp, and registered.  In the case of Hungary it is a bit more tricky. While we do have a precise number of how many were deported not all of them were killed on arrival or registered and admitted to the camp. The so-called Durchgangs-Juden (transit Jews) were kept temporarily in transit, to be dispatched to concentration camps in the Reich. The numbers for Hungary present as follows:  * Hungary: according to a telegram dated July 11, 1944, sent by the German ambassador in Budapest to the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, a total of 437,402 (438,000) Jews were deported to Auschwitz. The total number of transports was 148. Of the 438,000 Jews, as much as 25,000 could have been qualified as Durchgangs-Juden.  This results in a **revised sub-total of 728,000 deportees** – all Jews – from nine countries, about 703,000 of which were brought to Auschwitz and either killed on arrival or registered as camp inmates.   The figures for Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia are a bit less straightforward but the essence of it is that newest historical research shows that at least 300,000 and maybe as much as 350,000 Polish Jewish were deported to Auschwitz, some 23,000 German Jews were deported directly from Germany to Auschwitz (the total number of German Jews killed in Auschwitz is higher but that is the result from them being deported from France et. al. where they had fled before the war or from having been deported to Auschwitz from another camp such as Theresienstadt), and about 10,000 Jews were deported there from Yugoslavia.  That results in a **revised sub-total of 1,061,000 Jews** deported to Auschwitz.  Add to that, the about 34,000 Jews who arrived in Auschwitz from other concentration camps (e.g. Ravensbrück), that brings us to **a final total of 1,095,000 (1.1 million) Jews deported to Auschwitz**.  Since we have the number of registered prisoners in Auschwitz, we are able to reconstruct how many of them were killed on arrival:  &gt; * General number system, given to gentiles and Jews (May 1940 and later): 202,499 men and 89,325 women. Total:291,824 inmates. &gt; &gt; * Jews, A series (May 1944 and later): 20,000 men and 29,354 women. &gt; &gt; * Total: 49,354 inmates. &gt; &gt; * Jews, B series (May 1944 and later): 14,897 men. &gt; &gt; * Re-education prisoners: 9,193 men and 1,993 women. Total 11,186 inmates &gt; &gt; * Soviet prisoners of war: 11,964. Total 11,964 inmates. &gt; &gt; * Romani: 10,094 men and 10,888 women. Total 20,982 inmates. &gt; &gt; * Total: 400,000 registered inmates.  The A and B series total 64,251 Jewish inmates. On the basis of calculations taking into account the fact that virtually no Jews were registered in the camp before March 1942, and that after that date all the transports sent by the Reich Security Main Office contained exclusively Jews, Polish historian Franciszek Piper came to the conclusion that slightly less than half of the 291,824 inmates registered under the general number system were Jews. This brings a total of some 205,000 (64,000 +141,000) registered Jews.  Given the fact that 1,095,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz, and 205,000 were registered as inmates in the camp, it follows that 890,000 Jews who arrived were not registered. Of these some 25,000 would have been Durchgangs-Juden, which leads to the conclusion that **865,000 Jews were killed on arrival**."	human
96	"**Part 2**  Pelt continues:  &gt; The mortality of the registered Jews is more difficult to determine. It is clear that, of the registered inmates, 190,000 were transferred to other concentration camps–most of them after the death marches of January 1945. A total of 8,000 inmates were liberated by the Red Army on January 27, 1945, some 1,500 inmates were released, and some 500 escaped. This means that some 199,500 inmates, or roughly half of all the registered inmates, are accounted for. The rest, or 200,000, must have died in the camp. According to Piper, the mortality rate for the general camp population (mainly Poles and Jews), was around 50 per cent over the life of the camp–for the Soviet prisoners- of-war and the Romani it was much higher. As a result Piper came to a rough estimate of 100,000 registered Jews that died in the camp. The result is that the total mortality of Jews in Auschwitz was 960,000.  Added to that the numbers of other groups of victims, it looks like this:  * Jews: 860,000 unregistered and 100,000 registered inmates. Total 960,000 victims.  * Poles: 10,00 unregistered and 64,000 registered inmates. Total 74,000 victims.  * Romani: 2,000 unregistered and 19,000 registered inmates. Total 21,000 victims.  * Soviet prisoners-of-war: 3,000 unregistered and 12,000 registered. Total 15,000 victims.  * Others: 12,000 registered inmates. Total 12,000 victims.  * **Total: 1,082,000 victims.**  Or about 1.1 million victims. Not all of whom died in the gas chambers but also of shootings, starvation, forced labor and so on and so forth. However, it is clear that at least 865,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz were killed on arrival and thus the vast majority must have been killed in the gas chambers.  So, **from the Korherr Report, the Höfle Telegram (both supported by various other archival material), the Einsatzgruppen Reports, and the work of van Pelt, we arrive at a minimum number of killed Jews of about 4 million for Auschwitz, the Reinhard Camps, and the Einsatzgruppen**.  This however, is not all:  * In Chelmno, which was not part of the Aktion Reinhard, it is clear from German documents that at least 180.000, if not 200.000 Jews were murdered.  * Aktion Erntefest, the mass murder of the Jews from the Trawniki and Poniatowa Labor Camps and the Majdanek CC as ordered by Himmler and attested through documentation of Police Battalions, accounts for another 43.000 victims;  * As the files from the units involved in putting down the Warsaw Ghettos Uprising tell us, 12.000 Jews were killed during the fighting, 30.000 shot in the aftermath, and 7.000 deported to Auschwitz to be killed on arrival, which puts the total 49.000 victims;   * The Maly Trostinets camp, whose existence was known of through both German and Soviet documents have been [estimated by Yad Vashem](http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206636.pdf) to have at least had 65.000 victims as a minimum;  * In Serbia, Wehrmacht and SD files reveal that at least 20.000 Jews were killed, 8.000 shot by the Wehrmacht, 12.000 killed in the Gas Van at the Sajmiste camp;  * then there was the Intelligenzaktion, Sonderaktion Tannenberg, and the A-B Aktion in Poland, where both Jewish and non-Jewish Poles were killed and the minimum of Jewish victims is estimated at at least another 60.000;  * then there is Theresienstadt, where save those deported to Auschwitz, at least another 40.000 Jews died for certain following German documentation  This means that **from German documentation of large scale killing actions alone, we are up to about 4.5 million victims**, meaning these were the victims **directly killed**.  And this is where we get to starvation, diseases and other causes of death such as small killing operations and forced labor. There were also Ghettos where people were starved, worked to death, and shot. At least, again going by official documentation, 34.000 people died in the Lublin Ghetto, 92,000 people died in the Warsaw Ghetto, and 204.000 people in the Lodz Ghetto, and this doesn't even account for other big Ghettos like Krakow, Minsk, and Riga, in case of the latter two before the Einsatzgruppen arrived, which going – again – only by German accounts puts the number of victims somewhere in the 5 million range.  And then there is the last million so to speak, that is comprised of individual deaths on transports, deaths in the Reich and other territories that  were not part of larger killing scale actions like individual arrests, famine in the Soviet Union, and also, crucially, the deaths caused by other Axis members such as Romania, which killed at least 170.000 if not 240.000 Jews, Croatia, Bulgaria, and others.  Concerning the deaths by starvation, disease etc., it can absolutely be said that the Germans created the conditions that lead to the death of these people. Ghettoization was by design murderous and there is tons of German correspondence concerning Warsaw and other Ghettos that talks about the fear of disease spreading, meaning they were absolutely aware of the conditions they had wrought on their victims. The same goes for starvation: it was the Germans who fed their victims and they fed them not enough.  **Summing up**: We can directly from German documentation prove that the majority of victims of the Holocaust were directly killed. We can also prove from German documents that both disease and starvation were deliberate policies that directly lead to the death of Nazi victims.  Combing all these sources, we arrive at the following table:  Country| Est. Pre-War Jewish pop. | Est.

100	The other thing I would point out is that while a consideration of force comparisons and logistical limitations would lead you to believe the invasion was completely impossible, what was actually achieved in 1941 was far in excess of what I or most others would have told you was possible based on a dry reading of the situation. The high command was aware that the Soviets had enormous quantity of troops and equipment, but were relying on the Red Army being a less effective fighting force than it's paper strength would suggest. This turned out to be correct, but when calculating vague or fuzzy things like morale, organization and leadership, this introduces a large degree of uncertainty.   While I do have the personal opinion that a German victory in 1941 was not achievable, I also struggle to imagine how they could have dealt a more devastating blow to the Soviets. Their own operations planning did not stop them, the Red Army did. 	human
101	"(Are you really asking a question or are you stating your opinion? It feels like the latter with your ""many forget""...)  The options were not, and were never conceived at the time to be, a choice between land invasion and dropping two atomic bombs on two cities. There were several other possibilities discussed. [I have written about some of them here](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/08/03/were-there-alternatives-to-the-atomic-bombings/). Even the US military did not think that a land invasion was probably necessary, in retrospect:  &gt; _Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated._  One does not have to take their assessment as gospel — it was motivated by its own reasonings, some of which are debatable — but I like to offer that up just as a counterpoint to people who cling desperately to the idea that it was really a ""bomb or invade"" decision. The ""bomb or invade"" version of the story only became common around 1947, and was propagated by people who planned the atomic bombing (Stimson, Groves, Conant, others), because they wanted to shape the narrative about the bomb. The reason they wanted to do this was because many people, _including high-level members of the military_ (like Leahy and Eisenhower) were going on the record saying they thought the bombings were unnecessary.   Most historians that I know who study this believe that the attack on Hiroshima was probably to some extent inevitable given the circumstances but that the attack on Nagasaki was probably avoidable. [See this thread for more discussion on that](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7pz3nf/why_did_the_us_decide_to_bomb_both_hiroshima_and/).   (Separately, if you look beyond the summary paragraph of the Wikipedia article you will find many detailed discussions of casualty estimates with many citations.)"	human
102	Numerical superiority was certainly a factor but it was one of many and is usually over exaggerated due to the relative lack of Soviet accounts of the operation post war. I would argue that there were two main flaws in Nazi thinking during the planning stages: First, they considered the Soviet populace to be extremely resentful of their government and ready to capitulate at the first sign of defeat. This is partly true (due to the massive and deadly Stalinist reforms of the 20's and 30's), however Eastern Europeans quickly came to realize that the German plan for the east involved policies enslavement and butchery as well. While the Soviets had the excuse of saying that their reforms were paving the road for a future communist superpower (that would in the end benefit the entire working class), Nazi plans were based on strictly racial discrimination and conquest. A common misconception is that this only started to increase in severity towards the end of the war, but it was certainly policy from the beginning. This sort of treatment of occupied peoples led to widespread partisan uprisings, which in turn needed to be policed by men that could have been fighting on the  front line. To summarize the Nazis expected the previously enslaved Soviets to tolerate their new masters which was dead wrong in many eastern regions. Second, the German war economy was not bountiful enough to support their own troops albeit conquered peoples. Operation Barbarossa was initially created with a strict and unrealistic time frame in mind. To put this into perspective, think of what happened in the rest of Europe before the invasion of the Soviet Union. The Germans rolled over France, Poland, and may other countries in an extremely short amount of time compared to previous conflicts. The world was shocked and Hitler intended to ride that wave. The invasion of the Soviet Union was supposed to be more of the same, if not easier. Since the defenders knew what was in store for them if they lost, the attackers were met with fierce resistance.  There weren't sections of Mein Kampf dedicated to talking about enslavement of France, or Austria. The war in the east was much more brutal which resulted in fiercer resistance. As the time frame stretched out, food stores ran low. German troops were at times responsible for foraging their own food since none was coming from home. This poor preparation weakened their resolve greatly and contributed to defeat.  Sources: Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L Shirer.	human

104	Italians are crazy would be my start of the answer. (My last name has three I's in it, we are a weird group).   Major city states: Milan, Venice, Florence. Papal States, Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily.  These, through various wars with other city states ended up becoming the regional powers   Realistically it comes down to the political ambitions of each of the city states. They all had their own militaries at the time, however everyone was also linked through the papacy. A lot of people did want a United Italy, however they really couldn't agree on who would rule. Also, other nations consistently (France I'm looking at you) interfered through the Italian Wars. France did this to Germany as well, but Bismarck ended up doing his thing. Bismarck always had a plan.  Each of the families of the biggest city states pretty much held the political power. It should be noted that each of the families had different visions. For example, the Milan family of Sforza seized power through the military. He would later want all the power balanced. While Lorenzo the magnificent (Florence Medici family) would become famous for diplomacy. (Italic league/ Treaty of Lodi) Venice would also favor diplomacy.   The italic league was basically, although it didn't care a bit about the smaller city states in Italy, a try at unified Italy. Realistically, it kept the peace while prominent Italians poisoned each other instead. But it did establish a regional defense, again looking at France, and some type of infrastructure.   Then, we can talk about the widespread corruption. Italy really has only recently made strides against corruption, and it's hardly over. Yea this happened a bit later in their history, or at the least that's where the infamous part comes in. But I still feel the need to include this.   Tl/dr: everyone was consolidating power into the Renaissance. No one had enough, and to make sure they didn't kill each other forever (this had been going on for 100 years or so) the Treaty of Lodi was signed. This, through the successor in the italic league, would be as close to a unifed Italy we'd get for a while  NOTE: The italic league would fall apart with the death of Lorenzo De Medici and when Venice and The Papal invaded Milan in 1483. The treaty of Lodi would fall apart because of France in 1494. 	human

(Low quality mounts don't always mean low quality blades - after the wearing of swords was abolished, some good sword blades were recycled for tourist sale in such mounts.) One example of a good blade in good mounts: http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O92912/sword-and-scabbard-muneaki/  These combine something Japan was famous for (swords) with something visually striking (the carving) and compact enough for tourist luggage (these were usually short swords or tanto (i.e., knives)). Similarly, late 19th century China produced many short jian (swords) as tourist tat.  These were made in Japan for tourist sale until WW2 (after which swordmaking was closely regulated). Post WW2 swords like this are usually made in China (and are still being made).  Clothing was also a common tourist purchase - colourful and visually striking, distinctively Japanese, and luggage-compact.  &gt; How would a Westerner travel to Japan at this time?  Travel was by ship. Many of the early Western travelers in Japan were there for business (government or commercial). The Japanese government started promoting foreign tourism in the 1890s, and the number of tourists increased. Many of the early tourists included Japan as one stop among many in voyages around the world, or as part of a longer visit to Asia.  For a summary of early Western tourism in Japan, see Roger March, ""How Japan Solicited the West: The First Hundred Years of Modern Japanese Tourism "": http://www.inboundtourism.com.au/pdf/western-travel-in-japan-1868-1964.pdf"	human
111	I think he saw that there were undeniable discrepancies between the pantheon of gods and the real truth. In Euthyphro Socrates is talking to man who claims to know the will of the gods, named Euthyphro. Socrates asks “and do you believe that there is really war amount the gods, and terrible enmities and battles...” to which Euthyphro says yes that is all true as it was apart of the religion. If the gods are in conflict then they do not totally agree, if they cannot agree then they are not capable of conveying absolute truth. This question of what is absolute truth seems to be something that rocks the developement of later religions and philosophies.   When Religions were first developed it was to explain the world and after world and the Greek gods did that so with that answered they were able to move on to other questions like absolute truth. This is where is goes over my head at times in all honesty and it’s been a bit since I’ve read the complete works of Plato. This idea of absolute truth is what gets ourselves to the threory of the forms, the forms are not physical, but through wisdom one can glimpse them, this where you get the allegory of the cave. One so wise he can see the light for a moment and bring knowledge back into the cave. but we look at a later piece called the Cratylus now. In which he discuses the correctness of pronouns for a great deal, noting the flux and changes in languages, it isn’t set so languages are not absolute truth. But what about images he asks Cratylus if an exact copy of Cratylus was made would there be two Cratylus’ and the man says yes to which Socrates responds “so don’t you see we that we must look for some other kind of correctness in images and in the names we’ve been discussing....” Here he is hinting at something he’d elaborate more on in the Timaeus, the idea that our world whilst still the world of the seeming can have some hints of truth that can be sought out. That if in an image with only one difference from the original it still is very close.  The Timaeus is one of his later works, it’s improtant to remember that Plato is a person and people change their minds. It’s here where he seems the unswayed by the gods of his time as the Timaeus is whole work about the creation of the world, that there is a perfect world of the Forms and that a demiurge tried its best to recreate that world and that world is hours. Sooooo by the point of writing this it seems he wasn’t polytheistic. “Well, if this world of ours is beautiful and it’s craftsman good, then clearly he looked at the eternal model” this sounds a lot like modern ideal of God. So on that I’ll stop, wrote this out on my phone so I’m sure there are plenty of grammar mistakes that I’ll get to soon.   The book I quoted from is Plato Complete Works, edited by John Cooper.	human

118	"In 1285, the Statute of Winchester had updated and extended earlier English laws mandating able-bodied older teenagers and men to be ""sworn to arms"" for defense of the realm. Twice a year, they were obligated to report to a local muster for officials to make sure that they owned the proper arms (and also, would come when hailed for duty).   The type and amount of arms and armour that each man had to bring along was parceled out according to property, measured in both land and goods. Importantly here, even men whose wealth/property did not even register enough to be counted as ""goods and income less than 20 marks/year"" were still required to own and bring a bow and either arrows or bolts.  ""Defense of the realm"" was, of course, a flexible term. It could mean watching the coasts for potential invasion, actually fighting off invaders from the Channel, battling Scotland in the north, or simply acting as an internal police force/militia. However, through the Treaty of Bretigny in 1360, which marked the end of the first phase of the Hundred Years' War, England was still drawing its *overseas* troops from the ""defensive"" muster rolls.  John Alban stresses, however, that the selection of troops was already a *selection* at that point, even before the mercenary/semi-professionalization of the English army in the later decades of the 14th century. For overseas warfare, so-called captains were given much more leeway to specify what types of soldiers in what amount (cavalry, infantry) they intended to lead.  They did have the power to offer other incentives to potential troops. One proverbial carrot to dangle was the newly simmering idea of military service as a career--including the possibility of promotion and higher pay in the future. Easy peacetime garrison service after the war was not guaranteed, but might seem lucrative and attractive as well. More immediate ones included pardons for crimes and, well, being paid at all for having fought in that last campaign for which they were still owed money.   We know from letters and legal records that this was a major concern among soldiers, and their commanders both knew it *and used it*. Even before a tax-supported standing army, the system was becoming self-perpetuating: David Green notes that ""often the best way to secure wages for the last campaign was to sign on for the next."""	human
119	"Skill with a bow was essentially not just to be an archer but to be an English *man*, period. In 1285, as I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, the requirement to own arms and report for defensive/police duty when called was levied on all able-bodied men from ages 16 to 60. Even among the poorest peasants, ""arms"" meant bow and arrows/bow and bolts. Longbows, after all, are not *that* expensive.  They do require strength and practice, though! So as the Hundred Years' War stirred passions and a need for troops, additional laws sought to make sure that men owned those bows and used them. In 1357 and 1369, the English government tried to restrict English merchants from selling bows and arrows abroad. And in 1363, they instituted the famous requirement that all men had to *practice* archery, not just own a bow. "	human

And, to answer your question, yes, kulaks did hoarded grain. For a period, during the NEP, the official policy was to let peasants ""enrich themselves"", to gain consensus among the large masses of Soviet peasants. Later on, the official policy reversed to ""we should get over the 50-100 years of technological gap between USSR and the Capitalist World"". To do so, USSR needed to buy crops from peasants at lower prices to export them; kulaks, the richest and most enteprising of the peasants class, didn't like this ""change of mind"" from the government: so they refused to sell and/or destroyed the vegetables and the cattle. Then, the government began to forcefully confiscate lands and goods to these rich peasants.  At least, this is what I understood, I'll be glad if someone wants to correct me."	human

126	"So to me if we are to talk about WWII we have to also talk about the First World War as well. In the First World War conscription had a lot more to do with social classes; seeing poorer whites and minorities disproportionately conscripted. Yes this sounds messed up, but we actually had social boards to pick and choose people ""of non necessity, pious, and industrial parts of the country"".  But again they just singled out poor whites and minorities.   WW2 this would stop, but not until 1942. Again, before 1942 we would have more than 6000 local boards choosing who went and stayed. We would finally move to a lottery type of thing, which is still in place for emergencies. So to answer your question I'd say after 1942 there was still some sentiment that poorer citizens were disproportionally drafted but it would improve. Men didn't really "" look down"" on those not in the draft. And WW2 strongly differs by being a very popular war, where we had many volunteers en masse. I'm sure those in the military may have looked at people not drafted/ volunteers with scrutiny, but this would much more likely be an afterthought.   CO Or Conscientious Objectors.   Roughly 72,000 people applied, nearly 52,000 received CO status. Over 25,000 entered through non combative roles, another 12,000 on civilian work camps. Now here we see some really interesting stories, and also more likely to be scrutinized. Look up the story of Desmond Doss, the only CO Medal of Honor recipient from WW2 for a very cool war story (I remember reading it at a young age, he was a pacifist but really badass still) this should also give u a better idea of your original question.   Now draft dodgers, of which 373,000 were investigated and only just over 16,000 being convicted, would be seen in a much different light. They would likely be more well off financially, and would embrace grey areas to get out of conscription. This would be more my focus, personally, compared to those who the draft just ""didn't take"". Mostly because, post 1942, the system for draftees was much more fleshed out. And, these were the real assholes."	human

For my own part, the idea that the Catholic Church kept people in ignorance is ridiculous. The demand for educated Clergymen was one of the main drivers behind the founding of the earliest universities, and many if not most of the leading intellectuals of the Middle Ages had some association with the Church. After Fourth Lateran, there is a wealth of teaching texts specifically aimed at instructing Priests on how to preach effectively, so that the masses could *understand* the faith. There is, in fact, a widespread concern among clergy of all stripes with making good teaching available to more people. In short, the Catholic Church was both the widest provider of education and its biggest sponsor throughout the middle ages. 	human

Tomb entrances were were [sealed](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-psqHgXoUz5w/Vjdi8OFKaoI/AAAAAAAAAHs/fjeKAXITq3s/s1600/MtEBdAG%2B%25282%2529.jpg), walled up, and - until the reign of Seti I - concealed. A particularly effective technique was carving the tomb into a low-lying part of the wadi, which channeled water into the tomb entrances and camouflaged them after a flash flood. For more on this, see ""The Hydrology of the Valley of the Kings"" in *The Oxford Handbook of the Valley of the Kings* edited by Richard Wilkinson and Kent Weeks. After the reign of Seti I, the entrances to royal tombs were no longer concealed.   Workmen sometimes accidentally tunneled into older tombs while constructing a tomb (e.g. KV11 penetrated KV10), so it seems that the workmen were not aware of the exact layout of the older tombs.   2.

130	History in the academy question.  Is there any notion of identifying where we expect to get more evidence in the future, within the academy? Say for example: satellite photography showed some interesting new ruins in Syria, but that place is a war zone, and it may take decades for archaeologists to get to it; very little is known about the Empire of X, but Y kind of evidence likely exists because we have found it for peoples in similar contexts; this known trove of untranslated texts are in a bound up in a private estate, and will not be available until the litigation is over among the inheritors, etc.  I suppose I expect these things to be known to individual historians, but my question is whether there is formal/public effort to identify this sort of thing.	human

132	It isn't entirely accurate, but a simplification of the history.  Hinduism is a diverse set of loosely related religions originating in India.  Nearly all forms of Hinduism focus on the Vedas, Upanishads, and to a lesser extent, the Puranas.  These traditions all diverge in their interpretation of these books and their application.  For instance, not all Puranas and Upanishads are universally accepted or applied to all forms and many have supplementary texts and rituals.   Most forms of Hinduism have their roots in the Brahminical Orthodoxy, i.e. the Vedic and post-Vedic religions centred around a hereditary priesthood.  The development of Vishnu and Shiva, arguably the two most popular gods in Hinduism today, began in the late Vedic period and continued to develop until they had all but replaced classical Hindu gods in the 1-3rd centuries CE.  While there was a certain unification in these traditions seperate from Buddhism and Jainism, rarely were the forms of worship considered the same.  It was unlikely for one to worship both Shiva and Vishnu as equals and each had their own traditions.  The major unifying factor between these traditions, aside from the shared holy texts and priest tradition, was the Vedic philosophical thought.  Perhaps the most successful of these were Yoga and Vedanta, specifically the Advaita version.  Both traditions were wildly popular with the Vedic traditions and served as a unifying point.    During Islamic rule, the traditions of India were periodically suppressed by the Islamic ruling class.  To them, especially the early ones, there was little difference between the traditions.  That said, some Islamic rulers, even in the famously iconoclastic Delhi Sultanate, did see a unifying force between Hinduism and Islam, especially Vaishnavism.  The point though is that the Vedic traditions were grouped together during Islamic rule for the most part and unified in opposition to repression and later as a social and economic force in the Mughal court.  The colonial powers DID help codify Hinduism into a single unit, the treatment and common idea of Hinduism as a polytheistic religion by western conception.  And to some extent, it became that via the influence of neo-Vedantans, and later Gandhi, who attempted to spiritually unify all Indian traditions to create a sort of Indian national religion. 	human
133	Chevauchees tore through the countryside with abandon:  &gt; Losses and injuries were inflicted by friend and foe alike upon the rural population and upon monasteries standing in the open country. Everyone robbed them of their goods and there was no one to defend them. For this reason many men and women, both secular and religious were compelled on all sides to leave their abode and seek out the city … there was not a monastery in the neighbourhood of Paris, however near, that was not driven by fear of freebooters to enter the city or some other fortification, abandoning their buildings and, ‘Woe is me!’ leaving the divine offices unsung. This tribulation increased in volume, not only around Paris but also in the neighbourhood of Orléans, Tours, Nantes in Brittany, Chartres, and Le Mans, in an amazing way.  Now, our chronicler Jean de Venette here was the prior of a Carmelite monastery, so it's understandable that he stresses the onslaught against rural-based religious as well as peasants (though apparently he was from a peasant family rather than a noble one). However, there's plenty of evidence from rural and urban chronicles as well as government records and letters asserting that clerical/vowed religious status was of no real protection.  Some villages worked to fortify their local church or monastery to use as a community shelter when under assault, and that sometimes worked. But it wasn't a guarantee: the priest at Comblisy near Poitiers was kidnapped for ransom; English knights feasted at night on wine drunk from silver Eucharist chalices they had stolen from churches--including, in one report, from in the middle of Mass itself.	human

135	"There were black pulp writers; there were black writers and artists in comic books in the '40s, such as *All-Negro Comics* (1947). Yet for much of its history, fantasy fiction was very much dominated by white male writers—and the heroes of these stories were primarily white, with attitudes that had strong holdovers from Colonialist fiction and settings that were either based on European history (*The Lord of the Rings*, etc.) or images of exotic lands or distant periods of past or future (""The Hyborian Age"" of Conan the Barbarian, etc.). Then in 1974, a young African-American writer named Charles Saunders published ""M'ji Ya Wazimu (City of Madness)"" in the *Dark Fantasy* magazine—the first episode in what would become his Imaro series, based on an African cultural milieu. Not long after, Saunders also had an essay published: [""Die Black Dog! A Look At Racism in Fantasy Literature](http://reindeermotel.com/CHARLES/charles_blog42_dieblackdog.html) (1975). In his own words:  &gt; I was in my late 20s, and overflowing with ire and brimstone. The essay was something of *cri de coeur*.  The essay is something of a classic of its kind, although the few times it has seen print have almost always been met with pushback from readers and fans. Still, the opening lines are a very powerful and plainspoken statement of fact that few people can argue with:  &gt; For an avid reader of fantasy who happens to be black, the exclamation in the title of this essay pops up far too often for comfort. The genre-relate problems of reader identification and suspension of disbelief become immeasurably magnified with these words, because the ethnic epithets that spew from the mouth of a Conan are all-too-well represented in the grim world of reality. When blatant racism does occur in a fantasy tale, the black reader is rudely jerked from its escapist world. And when the escapism dies, so does the story.  Saunders then goes on to discuss how this pops up in the work of the three leading writers of *Weird Tales* in the 1930s, whose works were undergoing a revival in the 1970s paperback explosion of fantasy and sword &amp; sorcery: H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith. The essay is not really a criticism of the men, but of their fiction, and the isn't demanding equal representation (""Who needs black Hobbits?"") but rather asking to bring an awareness that the racial stereotypes which were acceptable in the '30s are not acceptable in the contemporary period.  ""Die Black Dog!"" is a little dated now—not so much in the general gist of its arguments, but simply because much more about Lovecraft, Howard, and Smith has been published since 1975, so some of his sources are out of date, and two of his targets (L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter) are now dead. There are better biographies, more correspondence, practically all their fiction down to rough drafts and synopses, have all seen print and been pored over by pulp scholars. We have a much better idea today of what these men thought about race, and how they used it in their fiction. Yet for all that study, it took someone like Saunders to actually *do* something about it, by writing his *Imaro* stories—to give readers a taste of what fantasy could look like, beyond Tarzan and Elric, Middle Earth and the Hyborian Age."	human

137	That is not the consensus. In fact, we trace the development of white supremacy in part through how people of African descent begin to be treated *worse* than indentured servants. The famous case here is one where a Virginia court punishes two runaway indentured servants with a finite extension on their time owed, while punishing a black man with them by extending his indenture to the rest of his life.   Indentured servants have rights and some degree of protection courtesy of the legal system. That doesn't mean their lives are ideal or that those rights were never transgressed, but there are important and substantive differences between unfree labor under indenture and being enslaved right from the start.

149	Quick answer: Up until this point the US government had been representing the NVA and VC as losing, and claiming progress in the ‘war’. I.e. victory is around the corner. At the same time a reasonable number of media outlets were questioning this position, there was growing opposition—already strong—and a variety of economic pressures—e.g. slowing economy, war material drain—were putting the American public under a great deal of pressure. The Tet Offensive showed how numerically and materially strong the NVA and VC were—demonstrating how far from over the war was. The loss of faith and face amongst those who supported the government compounded already failings support.	human

152	Quite the opposite; tradesmen were a vital demographic for military recruitment in the Hundred Years War (and throughout quite a bit of the medieval period). A skilled tradesman would have had a higher income than many, and therefore could provide some of his own equipment. If he was fortunate enough, he might be able to afford a mount and could contract as a mounted archer, therefore receiving a higher rate of pay. On military muster rolls, we see numerous last names indicating tradesmen (Armorer, Tailor, etc.) appearing as archers. It appears that the skilled workers associated with a royal or aristocratic household would also accompany their master on the battlefield as archers. Military service was also one path for upwards mobility for a lucky soldier; many men-at-arms appear to have begun their careers as archers. The loot and ransom that could potentially be acquired could be put towards acquiring land and livestock that would improve the lot of the archer and his family. 	human

168	"It's a complicated question, but generally a serf during the Russian Imperial period was treated like and on the same level as a slave. However, complications arise in that *generally* the serf only had to do whatever work was assigned to them and could go about their daily life generally without too many disturbances - not slave-like at first.  Unlike a peasant, however, serfs were bound to their land and their land only. They could not move or leave their rulers' territory, and were kept in a cycle of generational indentured servitude and poverty, so as to never be able to make any sort of personal or familial capital. Serfs were also treated as property, rather than people, and they could be sold and beaten at will by their owner, with no recourse.  Despite Alexander II's reforms, manumission and emancipation, serfdom remained on an informal level even with ""freed"" peasants. Russian society was excessively bureaucratic and the gentry and bureaucracy opposed freedoms, thus forming a system that was excessively legalistic and required great effort to maneuver. Most gentry did not bother, and serfs that were freed could hardly understand it. Even when freed, serfs were uprooted from their communities and often lived in even worse poverty or became informal slaves to money-lenders or others who would offer them land and then ensure that the serfs would be kept in a cycle of debt and poverty that would lead to the same generational slavery that was previously.   The Russian Empire was also excessively fearful of serf and peasant uprisings, and this meant that repression was near-constant and excessive. Gun ownership would be near impossible for a serf, even though many were conscripted to fight in Russian wars for long periods of time and had at least some experience.  Sources:  Pereira, N.G.O.

173	"About a year ago, I did some research that ended up at a strange intersection of Japanese and Black American history. It sprung from a friend`s question: Did Charles Sumner meet the 1860 Japanese delegation to America? I'd been thinking mostly about the Japanese experience of America, but researching this, I learned about what the Japanese visit signified to Americans about race and slavery.  On May 14, 1860, the Japanese delegation arrived in Washington DC to much fanfare, the first time in centuries Japan had sent a mission oversea. Every politician and socialite in DC was falling over themselves to meet the delegation of “Japanese princes” (actually, minor officials of the shogunate, including Oniwaban member Muragaki Norimasa). The rumour was Japan had fabulous wealth that would now flow into American pockets via trade.   On May 17, a reception was held at the White House, the rooms packed with officials and politicians. May 23, the Japanese delegation visited the Capitol to observe a debate in congress. May 25, there was a huge banquet at the White House.The Japanese delegation finally left town for Baltimore on June 8.   The entire time they’d been in DC , crowds had followed their every move. Before sailing home, the delegation continued on to Philadelphia and New York City; the latter tried to outdo the other cities by having a parade in the delegation’s honour.   Now, on June 4, 1860, while the Japanese delegation was still in DC, Charle Sumner gave a speech to the senate, which he later published as a pamphlet entitled “ The Barbarism of Slavery.”   &gt;“Under what ordinance of Nature or of Nature’s God is one human being stamped an owner and another stamped a thing?”   Sumner asks in his speech. His opponents, he says, have some very feeble arguments to justify slavery.  &gt;The first is the alleged inferiority of the African race; an argument which, while surrendering to Slavery a whole race, leaves it uncertain whether the same principle may not be applied to other races, as to the polished Japanese, who are now the guests of the nation, and even to persons of obvious inferiority in the white race.   That is, He’s calling out pro-slavery apologists on their BS. “So you believe other races are inferior? Want to tell that to our wonoured guests whom you’re fawning over for their elegance?”  So yes, Sumner met the delegation. Furthermore, I learnt Sumner’s remarks here were reflective of some excited discourse among abolitionists, both white and black. You can read an excellent article on this subject: [Reactions to the First Japanese Embassy in the United States](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43294359) by Reginald Kearney, which traces reactions in terms of American racism and attitudes towards slavery.   &gt;Many blacks and antislavery whites, in the year before the Civil War began, dared to hope that the honor bestowed upon the colored men from across the sea would harbinger a new era in American race relations. The Anglo-African exulted, “the colored people are now in high honor,“ ""prejudice against a dark complexion seems to be vanishing.” All the beating of drums, playing of fifes, and waving of handkerchiefs, the writer marveled, were in honor of a few carriages of colored people whose faces he described as “tinged with a very unpopular Blackish-brown.” (pp. 98-99)  Other observers noticed a darker side, with crowds yelling racial slurs at the Japanese ambassadors, three years after the Dred Scott decision.  &gt;Horace Greely, [sic] editor and publisher of the New York Herald Tribune , declared that the epithets ""there go the niggers,” “monkeys, ""and ""Japs” were the sentiments of the great heart of the nation as reflected in the Dred Scott decision, which determined that a colored man had no rights that a white man was bound to respect; Japanese were free men of color.” (p. 98)  (“great heart of the nation” of course is sarcastic here. Greeley was an abolitionist.)  &gt;Frederick Douglass, the premier black abolitionist, struck a similar note, “We hate ‘niggers’ by a habit which has become second nature and we pour contempt upon all the dark races of men. This hate enters into all our laws, letters, manners, and customs.” Yet, Douglass thought Japanese might have gained valuable insight regarding American society. These children of the sun, he wrote,heard themselves called “niggers! niggers! in a manner which left no doubt that a term of contempt and reproach was applied to them. From this little word of reproach by which they found themselves stigmatized, he reasoned, they had learned more about America institutions than they could have received by years of reading at a distance. That stigmatization formed a bond between blacks and Japanese:  &gt;While we would not have any one insulted on account of color, we have perhaps, on the grounds that misery loves company, a little satisfaction in seeing the epithet always insultingly applied to us, extended to persons of such distinction as those who make up this famous [Japanese] Embassy. (p 98)  Unfortunately, Douglass was way too optimistic. What the Japanese embassy actually learnt about race in America is really sad and depressing, namely that the Western world had a strict racial divide and they didn’t want to be on the wrong side of it. The Japanese arrived in the United States finding white people ugly. Within weeks, they were fawning over fair hair and complexions, while disparaging dark skin.  The book *As We Saw Them* by Masao Miyoshi, devotes some attention to the Japanese conceptions of race, and it's absolutely awful. The Japanese members of the expedition either ignored or eagerly swallowed up explanations of racial hierarchies, and the need for segregation and slavery. (One exception was one of the Duch-speaking translators, who had apparently already been schooled in anti-slavery ideas by the Dutch at Nagasaki.)  Mostly the Japanese mission had no real contact with black Americans, since they spoke no English, and were kept separate. But there's one heart-rending story (set down by one of the head ambassadors) about an interpreter and a black woman in Washington D.C.  &gt;Ever since our arrival here, all of us had been giving presents (like fans, pictures, and toys) to children, hotel employees, waiters, and waitresses who had been attending us. Almost everyone had been provided with something by now, and those Americans who owned no Japanese gifts looked almost embarrassed. But it seems that those who had received our presents turned out to be mostly white and attractive people. One day a black woman approached one of our servants who spoke some English, tearfully confiding to him that since Nature had given her a black exterior, she was scorned by everyone and was not lucky enough to be given presents from anybody, and that she hated herself. She also said white people—even children—were getting presents from the Japanese, but she and her people who had such an ugly look received nothing. He felt so sorry for her that he gave her a fan, and she was very grateful. It seems that the whites are beautiful and shrewd and intelligent; and the blacks are ugly and stupid. So the whites always despise the blacks. There are some white-and-black marriages, and their children are between white and black in complexion. (p. 63, *As We Saw Them*)"	human

177	From an [earlier answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/75wxh1/what_did_the_ussr_do_in_the_great_depression/)  The advent of the Depression was one of the major propaganda coups for the nascent USSR and Stalin's dictatorship. The global scale of the Depression appeared to validate the Marxist-Leninist that capitalism was inherently unstable and the mass unemployment would finally lead to the long-predicted uprising by the proletariat. The USSR was relatively well-positioned to weather the Depression itself. The economic cordon around the USSR was fraying in the 1920s, but one of its legacies was that the USSR was not all that connected up into global markets in 1929. The Soviet Union was insulated from the effects of the Depression, however, the global downturn in the economy did not leave the Soviets unscathed.   One of the immediate reactions of the major world economies to the Depression was preotectionism and tariffs. The rise of protectionist tariffs made it much less profitable for the Soviets to export grain, timber, and other raw materials to acquire foreign goods that could not be produced within the Soviet Union. The Soviets' solution to this problem was typically Stalinist: simply export more. The exports of wheat grew from 200 000 tons to two million tons between 1929-1931. This increase in agricultural exports came at an acute time in Soviet agriculture and added yet more hardship to the Soviet public. These export policies were a contributing factor to famine conditions in Ukraine between 1931-32.  The state also auctioned off art treasures and *Torgsin* shops sold special consumer items to Soviet citizens for precious metals which would be in turn the state would use to pay for foreign imports.    The most acute period of Soviet agricultural export (1931) coupled with the nadir of the global Depression, so the detrimental effects exports had on the Soviet economy appeared relatively slight to outsiders. As a whole though, the Soviet economy exhibited a great deal of growth during the Depression. The Soviets were able to import technical experts and specialists from the West that they might not otherwise in a better global economic climate as many Western firms were desperate for scarcer funds. The Ford Motor Company helped set up a state of the art automobile factory in Nizhnii-Novgorod and other American firms aided the massive tractor factories in Stalingrad and Kharkov. Modern foreign machinery also greatly assisted the Stalinist crash industrial drive and helped to create a truly massive heavy industry sector within the USSR. Foreign specialists became a more common sight in the various Stalinist projects. The massive steel city town of Magnitogorsk had a small American enclave, termed *Amerikanka*, for American steel engineers. The presence of these foreign specialist provided fodder for a number of conspiratorial-minded types in the Cold War that capitalists had funded the USSR, but the reality was more mundane. The foreign specialists provided a degree of initial guidelines, but the Soviets proved to be apt pupils. Soviet engineers easily took over the foreign expertise and the importation of expertise was more of a hothouse incubator for the development of Soviet heavy industry than something necessary for its genesis.    In this retrospect, the Depression helped render the Soviet economy much more efficient. There were significant human costs to the Soviet government's response to the Depression, namely both in higher grain requisitions and reinforcing the Stalinist drive to go all in on the development of heavy industry. But these human costs did not eclipse the great propaganda value the USSR gained from the Depression.  Soviet growth rates in GNP far exceeded the growth exhibited by their capitalist counterparts. This considerably helped the Soviet Union's ideological appeal and added luster to the Soviet experiment.   *Sources*  Davies, Robert William, S. G.

178	"To start with, the rapier is not an armour-penetrating weapon, and not all swords that are long and thin are made to pierce armour. Rapiers themselves have a number of characteristics that show their civilian nature.  Now, some longer, thinner swords are made for piercing through the gaps of armour in war. The most extreme example of this is the [Estoc](http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1916.686) a long, stiff, thin sword with an acute point and no edges at all - a pure thrusting weapon. This may sound a bit like a rapier, but it is solely a weapon for armoured fighting on foot in war and tournament, and it is meant to be used two handed, often [half swording](http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1916.686) to find the gaps in armour. While rapiers have edges (and earlier proto-rapiers were used to cut), estocs have no edge at all, and often have a triangular or square cross section, like the awl point on a polearm head. Perhaps we could view estocs as an indirect inspiration of rapiers, but one way in which they are related is that any sort of long thin sword requires higher-quality steel construction, and in the 15th century all-steel, often single-piece swords increasingly replace blades made of steel and iron, or made of multiple pieces. The same technology that made estocs possible made rapiers possible 50 years later.   In contrast to Estocs, and rapiers many of the more 'normal' swords that seem intended for penetrating the gaps of armour aren't particularly thin, though they might be long. Many are [triangular](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/31/6f/03316fab080c8a159c8ea982098f61a6.jpg) or are trangles with [slightly curved sides](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/2d/b4/402db4ceccd044d8d2c996bb734977fb.jpg). Many, many swords of this sort are 30"" or under, including the famous [sword from the tomb of Henry V](http://dailynews.lk/sites/default/files/news/2015/10/30/z_p12%2BHenry-V%E2%80%99s.jpg) and many of the swords from the Castillon finds, illustrated above in groups. Shorter and longer swords seem to have served beside each other on the battlefield - someone better versed in fencing manuals can confirm my suspicion that these personal preferences probably came down to reach versus quickness and maneuverability. The longest single-handed late medieval swords are around 36"" long and still have a decent blade thickness, like this nearly [35"" example at the Wallace Collection](http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=DynamicAsset&amp;sp=SU5mxm4Yx%2FVbg9LVP7MZLDqo6z5lhONBxez%2FYx5EhVSCZjU0bcvvsnPxkoLiFJnF9QzRY98OZwV1b%0AfnOjhdzPJCrGy%2BOIZxfXys9Yi8S8yOIRd4M6zPCk6ZqlPqbqrNmy&amp;sp=Simage%2Fjpeg). Rather than a very long, mostly straight-sided blade like a later rapier, it is a blade that is very acutely tapered; while still a thin sword it has a thicker base than a rapier. The reason for this is is that if you're thrusting into the gaps of armour (especially trying to penetrate mail) you need that acute point to act as a wedge to thrust in, and you need a blade that is stiff and won't bend. An estoc, without the need to be sharp on the edge, could have a cross section that was thick in all dimensions - a flatt(ish) blade of a two-edged sword will need to be broader to get the same stability and strength. Writing in 1590, the retired English Soldier, proto-nationalist and all-around curmudgeon John Smyth wrote that rapier blades ""...being so narrow, and of so small substance, and made of a very hard temper to fight in privat frays, in lighting with any blow upon armour, do presently break, and so become unprofitable."" To conclude, there are fairly long, fairly thin swords for war that may well be intended for thrusting threw gaps in armour, but their blade shape is broader and 'pointier' than later rapiers.  There -were- some later medieval swords that were less pointed and still rather long. You begin to see more of these in the later 15th century and early 16h century, such as [this example](http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=61033&amp;viewType=detailView) and [This one](http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=60992&amp;viewType=detailView), both at the Wallace collection in London. Also in the 15th century you see the development of more involved protection for the hand, such as [this Italian sword from before 1432](https://collections.royalarmouries.org/object/rac-object-121.html) and [the characteristic double-ringed Iberian hilt of the later 15th century on this sword attributed to Ferdinand the Catholic](http://pics.myarmoury.com/spanish01a_s.jpg).  In the early 16th century (and even the later 15th, perhaps) swords roughly like this - longish, pointy, good for war or for civilian self defense - began to be worn with civilian clothes in a wider variety of circumstances in Italy and Spain (in the Middle Ages, swords were mostly carried by soldiers or travellers - municipalities tried to ban or otherwise discourage the carrying of swords in cities and towns, for fear or violence). It is likely that a Spanish term for this, Espada Ropera or 'sword of the robe' (sword for civlian dress) is the origin of the term 'rapier.' But at first these swords were very similar to or identical to military swords.  [The classic rapier](http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=61033&amp;viewType=detailView) - incredibly thin blade with an acute point, complex hilt, worn with civilian dress, fighting in a style that emphasized the point - had emerged by the mid 16th century, by which time people are alternately singing its praises and condemning it as the murderous and militarily useless tool of urban feuds. A large factor in the development of its pointy, incredibly long form and its adoption was the new philosophy of fencing established by Camillo Agrippa and Camillo Palladino. These masters held that thrusts were the most efficient attacks, and lunging and otherwise extending the reach made thrusts quicker and deadlier. This system of thrusting from a relatively significant distance called for a longer sword that was optimized for thrusting. Thus, the rapier as we know it. Its length is for reach, not for sliding into the gaps in armour, and its design for the thrust is to allow for quick attacks, not the penetrate mail.  And what did this sword look like by say, 1600? It was often incredibly long. Where the single-handed swords of the Middle Ages 'max out' at around 36"" (90 cm or so) and many are under 30"" long, many rapiers are over 40"" (100cm+) long, longer than most medieval 'bastard' swords, much less single-handed swords. Being made to thrust, not cut, they could afford to be long and thin. The fencing masters themselves  talked about proper sword length. Ridolfo Capo Ferro in his 1610 work on fencing derided swords that are too long and malproportioned to the wielder's body, but then recommended that the ideal sword was twice the length of a man's arm! This gives a length of somewhere around 140 cm on average, or a blade more than 55"" long, well over 4 feet. And indeed, there are surviving 17th century rapiers that are that long. However, their sheer length and thinness made them less than ideal military weapons, as Smythe says. They are best seen as the highly specialized product of the purpose they were designed for - fencing in an unarmoured, civilian context, using a system fencing that emphasized lunging thrusts that required a great deal of reach.

185	That is a bit complicated, but I'll try to sum it up as best as I can!   Austria-Hungary was a dominant and oppressive force in the region at the time and treated non-Austrian or Hungarian nationalities with disdain. Serbian and Slavic nationalists, who wanted to see the creation of an independent Yugoslavia, Greater Serbia or other South Slav state, used this to stir political action against Austria-Hungary and encouraged others to engage in terrorism and rebellion.   This caused continuous instability in the Austro-Hungarian empire, which resulted in a cycle of repression and terrorism which radicalized many slavic youths against the Hapsburg monarchy.  Franz Ferdinand was one of the most important people in the Austro-Hungarian Empire at that point as the Heir Apparent and Inspector General of the Armed Forces. He was seen as a figurehead for Austrian power in the region, and it was hoped that by assassinating him, a bedrock for revolution against Austro-Hungarian authority could be formed, which would lead to the creation of an independent Yugoslav or South Slav state.  The Black Hand then enlisted Princip and his friends, most of them radicalized youths who were themselves determined to carry out the assassination, as they had the means to arm them and prepare them for the assassination. It was hoped that by assassinating the Arch-Duke, not only could a revolution begin, but that it would serve as a symbolic shattering of Austro-Hungarian dominance and a message to the Austro-Hungarian rulership.   **Sources:**  Jackson, P. ‘Union or Death!’: Gavrilo Princip, Young Bosnia and the Role of ‘Sacred Time’ in the Dynamics of Nationalist Terrorism  Dusanic, D. ‘Steering the Wheel of History’: Gavrilo Princip, Ivo Andrić and the men of 1914.	human

188	"""Pike &amp; shot"" refers to large formations of infantry using combined polearms (pikes) and arquebus or musket (shot).  Typically even numbers of each were employed and they were usually handled in a square or banded square formation (this is an inner square of pikeman with outer lose squares of musketeers).  An excellent example is the Spanish tercio used to devastating effect in the 30 Years War.  The advantage of this formation is that it could use mass volley fire of the notoriously inaccurate muskets to soften an enemy infantry formation while allowing those same musketeers to retreat behind pikes to withstand a cavalry attack.  A prepared unit would form a full square against cavalry and be able to repel the charge as horses won't knowingly charge sharp pikes.  The disadvantage of the formation is that it was large, unwieldy and unable to cope with a fluid battlefield.  As accuracy &amp; rate of fire of guns improved (slowly moving in to flintlocks) and similar advances in field artillery were realised, more of the ponderous formations had to be drawn off into screening or skirmishing elements.  Eventually, firearm accuracy was such that those thinner formations became the norm.  With the development of the bayonet, such skirmishers could effectively act as their own pikeman and the Pike &amp; Shot era was over.  I'm not sure why Total War franchise fans would want to include pike &amp; shot formations in their game.  The slow moving tercio style squares are simply not that interesting; battles between them were more often decided by which formation could absorb more punishment than by manoeuvre on the field.  A key tactic was to use this against the formation by pinning it against another similar unit and then perform slashing attacks on the flanks eg. with now unopposed cavalry.  I suspect what they really want is to re-create Breitenfeld and Gustav II Adolf's famous destruction of Tilly's army.  However, to do that, the Swede employed formations which were markedly different to the traditional pike &amp; shot units of his opponent.  The greater flexibility allowed him to take his opponent in the flanks.  Disclaimer:  I am a wargamer and avid reader of the history of the 30 Years War.

189	 Somewhat follow up question or discussion.. I'd be curious if even into the current era (say late 80s for sub rules) if a European reader may likely be more able to decipher something like this simply due to the closer proximity to these cultures as members of the same continent than an American that doesn't have as much potential to run into media or individuals speaking a different language on a regular basis. Given that the phrases are fairly straight forward I'm thinking this is potentially one factor that would lead to this style being used. Or to think about it in a flipped sense, if Spanish was written into an American novel similarly I'm expecting I could likely form the gist given context and my loose experience with the language. I'd expect and be curious for proof that it's similar in Europe.	human

191	That's a really good point.  My best example from recent reads would be the works of Cormac McCarthy.  He injects a ton of simple Spanish into his novels, but they are understandable to most Americans.  Another similar situation would be the untranslated French in the novels of Dostoyevsky.  The exchange of cultures makes the use of untranslated language more relatable.  I wish I had more academic sources, but that is the best anecdotal evidence I can think of.	human
192	"So, the relationship of speeches in the ancient historians to “what really happened” is very difficult to understand, and it’s commonly taught to undergrads (including myself) that the historians “made up” the speeches, it’s a very unfair characterization.  The classic text about method of treating speeches is Thucydides, 1.22: &gt;Insofar as these facts [his account of the Peloponnesian War] involve what the various participants said both before and during the actual conflict, recalling the exact words was difficult for me regarding speeches I heard myself and for my informants about speeches made elsewhere; in the way I thought each would have said what was especially required in the given situation, I have stated accordingly, with the closest possible fidelity on my part to the overall sense of what was actually said.  This passage is often taken to mean that all Thucydides’ speeches are made up; imaginary speeches that suit the characters and the situation, like in a play.  But like almost everything Thucydides says, someone else thinks it means the exact opposite.  Donald Kagan (although there is a long bibliography on what this phrase means – and whether Thucydides sticks to his stated method) most publicly argued that this means Thucydides *did not* make up his speeches – he presented his speeches with the greatest possible fidelity to what what actually said, as far as he or his witnesses could remember!  This obviously is problematic: sure, the Funeral Oration might be well-remembered with many witnesses to give accounts, but something like the Melian dialogue?  How does he know what was said in a private conference in a far-away place?  To many it seems shocking that Athenian ambassadors would be as brazenly cynical while trying to win an ally as Thucydides presents them.  I happen to like Kagan on this point; I think speeches are as good as the author’s evidence for them.  So what evidence for actual speeches might have been available?  Thucydides has already mentioned memory and witnesses – a limited help, but some help at least.  Orators, both in Athens and in Rome, published speeches.  Demosthenes and Cicero are the most famous, but there are others that survive.  Speeches in Rome at least (an example in Greece doesn’t come immediately to mind) could also be inscribed.  Pliny the Elder, Natural History, VII.28.104-106, gives a biography of the Roman war hero M. Sergius Silus, who fought in Punic II.  He attributes his knowledge of Sergius’ life to a speech Sergius gave defending himself from ejection from a priesthood, which had been inscribed and survived to Pliny’s day.    Tacitus took advantage of at least one such inscription when he wrote his account of Claudius’ speech to the Senate in 48 CE.  An apparently verbatim inscription appears in the [Lyon Tablet](http://comp.uark.edu/~cmuntz/texts/claudius-lyon-speech.html).  Tacitus gives a version of this speech at [*Annales* 11.23-24](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Tac.+Ann.+11.23&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078).  It’s clear to me that Tacitus is familiar with the text as represented in the Lyon Tablet (though some scholars are more interested in how Tacitus departs from the Tablet), at least as far as the arguments go.  He does, however, restructure the argument, cut out superfluous bits, and does general tightening.  I’m just going to produce two passages as a demonstration of the sort of thing Tacitus is up to.  In Claudius’ speech as given in the Lyon Tablet, Claudius presents two objections to his motion that Gauls should be admitted to the Senate: &gt;But, you may say, is not an Italian senator more useful than a provincial one?  and &gt;It is time now, Tiberius Caesar Germanicus, to reveal to the senators where your speech is headed; for you have already come to the extreme limits of Gallia Narbonensis.   This last comment is a concern about the geographical reach of the new Senators Claudius proposes.  Tacitus took these objections out of the speech proper and puts them in the mouths of Claudius’ opposition: &gt;In the consulship of Aulus Vitellius and Lucius Vipstanus the question of filling up the Senate was discussed, and the chief men of Gallia Comata, as it was called, who had long possessed the rights of allies and of Roman citizens, sought the privilege of obtaining public offices at Rome. There was much talk of every kind on the subject, and it was argued before the emperor with vehement opposition. ""Italy,"" it was asserted, ""is not so feeble as to be unable to furnish its own capital with a senate. Once our native-born citizens sufficed for peoples of our own kin, and we are by no means dissatisfied with the Rome of the past. To this day we cite examples, which under our old customs the Roman character exhibited as to valour and renown. Is it a small thing that Veneti and Insubres have already burst into the Senate-house, unless a mob of foreigners, a troop of captives, so to say, is now forced upon us? What distinctions will be left for the remnants of our noble houses, or for any impoverished senators from Latium? Every place will be crowded with these millionaires, whose ancestors of the second and third generations at the head of hostile tribes destroyed our armies with fire and sword, and actually besieged the divine Julius at Alesia. These are recent memories. What if there were to rise up the remembrance of those who fell in Rome's citadel and at her altar by the hands of these same barbarians! Let them enjoy indeed the title of citizens, but let them not vulgarise the distinctions of the Senate and the honours of office.""   It deals with the same objections, but removes them from the middle of the speech (where they are in the Lyon Tablet) and Tacitus makes Claudius’ speech respond to them, making both the objections and arguments more forceful.  This is an interesting move by Tacitus, because the general thought is ancient historians did not produce speeches that were elsewhere published.  It may suggest that, while Tacitus was aware of the content of the speech, the inscription was difficult to use or not well known, and so he felt fine reproducing an edited version.  Sallust took what we think of as the usual approach: in his Catilinarian Conspiracy, he didn’t give anything about Cicero’s four great speeches but passed over them in favor of the speeches of Caesar and Cato (and a speech delivered in secret by Catiline – and again, we can wonder what his source for that was).  Cicero’s speeches of course were widely published by Cicero himself.  Sallust did not feel comfortable reproducing them or versions of them in his own work.  Another source in the Roman period was the *Acta*, the daily record of public events.  These were strange documents we don’t understand terribly well, but they seemed to be a sort of daily political bulletin reporting court cases and other public business.  They don’t seem to be used very often as a source, but Asconius used them in his commentary on Cicero’s speeches, so some people were looking at them.  One thing we learn from Asconius’ commentary on Cicero’s *Pro Milone* (37C) is: &gt;Q. Pompeius, C. Sallustius [That’s Sallust, our non-plagiarizing historian!], and T. Munatius Plancus, tribunes of the plebs, were among the first to hold *contiones* that were extremely hostile toward Milo, and calculated also to arouse animosity against Cicero for his strenuous efforts to defend Milo.  We imagine this sort of detail was taken out of the *Acta*.  *Contiones* were public meetings where magistrates addressed the People of Rome.  Here we have the speakers and a summary of the content.  So ancient historians had all of these things to help them not make up speeches, but of course the verisimilitude of the speech can only be as good as the sources they have to work with.  Livy’s early books, for instance, have speeches it’s very hard to believe are grounded in any meaningful evidence.  These situations provide an opportunity for a more imaginative piece, suited to the needs of the moment and the character of the speakers, as the careless reader of Thucydides might think he means to say his is method.  There are some scholars who think Livy is pulling those sorts of speeches from actual drama, or if they are original he’s imitating drama in those moments.  As I said, there is a huge bibliography on this question, with scholars thinking the speeches are more or less real, as well as arguing about specific speeches.  The important thing, I think, is when confronted with a speech in an ancient historian, to consider how the historian might know what they report, and to build your ideas about whether the speech was made up from there."	human
193	Off the top of my head, you would need to look no further than Caesar’s writings such as the Gallic War, where he referred to himself in the third person. While I am no authority on writing tropes of the 1860s, the argument can be made that Winfield Scott may have been writing in the third-person to emulate that style, after a fashion.	human
194	"(I have read much more extensively about Phoenician expansion into the western Mediterranean, so someone else would probably have more insight into the internal Greek dynamics which led them to colonize outside of *Hellas*.)  But to quote Maria Eugenia Aubet from her book *The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade*: ""The Greek enterprise seems to have derived from colonialist ideas, and the Phoenician enterprise to have been content with founding trading establishments close to indigenous communities."" In short, they had different motivations for setting up colonies, and thus experienced different outcomes. And while their are some obvious similarities in the earliest colonial expansions by both civilizations - establishing trading posts to find raw materials - their colonies developed in far different ways.  The Phoenician expansion, led by Tyre, has to be seen through the lens of their delicate role as intermediaries between Great Powers  (chiefly Assyria, also but Egypt and Persia),  their relationships with neighbors like Israel, and role in the burgeoning economies of the western Mediterranean societies (Tyre's trading partners in Spain, Portugal, Italy and N. Africa). Tyre, a mercantile power, had a long-term strategy to make themselves, or more specifically, their kings, priests and councils, irreplaceable: they had a powerful a monopoly supplying raw metal ore to Assyria (and Egypt, Persia, and the Canaanite states), and in the  production of certain manufactured goods. In exchange, the Punic city-states received hundreds of years of peace and preferential treatment by the Assyrians (Assyria at one point forcing one of Tyre's upstart vassals in Cyprus into resuming paying tribute) and a reliable flow of agricultural foodstuffs (Israel had plenty of grain to trade, and no one could supply its kings with fine pottery, linens, lumber and ore quite like Tyrians).  The lure of metal - silver and gold for coinage, copper, tin and iron for tools - is paramount. The earliest Phoenician colonies, Kytion and Carthage (Carthage is the Latinization of Punic *Qart Hadasht*, or ""New City, *City* referring in both Cypriot and African Carthage to their mother city Tyre) in Cyprus and Gadiz in Andalusia, were established to monopolize metal sources. The Phoenicians not only trades raw metals, but operated factories and refineries to shape those metals- the western Mediterranean had it's own indigenous economy, fueled by Phoenician ships and advanced Phoenician smelting/metalworking; carbon-dating reveals a plethora of Greek and Italian goods found their way to Andalusia far before those societies themselves began to expand. These metal-centric settlements were also the first to expand, doing so out of the resource surpluses. Gadiz, modern day Cadiz, was the trading partner and refining center for the Iron-Age Kingdom of Tartessos in southern Spain, which was itself founded on the Rio Tinto mining complex; after the Phoenicians introduced their more advanced metallurgical techniques, the complex' production exploded, and the quantities of gold, silver, copper and iron overwhelmed the Tyre-Gadiz trade route, allowing Gadiz itself to create new satellites to trade its excess metal for both *different* metals and agricultural goods. All these colonies, you may note, are dependent on shipping routes for survival - the vast Phoenician trade hub was it's own unique organism.  Metal was a powerful magnet magnet for the Greeks as well, but moreso than Tyre and its sisters, the Greeks also founded *agricultural* colonies to immediately relieve mainland overpopulation and create new sources of food.  Tyre also dealt with overpopulation and food crises - it was the premier Mediterranean city, with its metropolitan area stuck on a small island, and it's hinterland constrained to suburbs and farmland not much larger - but for whatever reasons, found the solution in Asia instead of its Mediterranean colonies: Tyre expended a great deal of energy and resources founding settlements near the Tigris, intimidating its Canaanite neighbors and in turns negotiating/warring with Israel for both agricultural products and access to its hinterlands for settlement. Greece, without agriculturally productive neighbors of its own to trade or war with, instead relieved their demand for food with a sea-borne colonial enterprise. It is unclear just how united or disunited the cities of the Canaanite coast really were on the whole; it seems that Tyre's hegemony came at the expense of Byblos and Sidon, and that Tyre did little to protect its siblings from predatory states.  I mention this disunity because the simple fact that Tyre alone was the chief Punic colonizing power means simply that there were fewer colonists (Carthage's dominance only came about after the sacking of Tyre by Alexander the Great around 330BCE, when a flood of refugees brought their wealth and manufacturing expertise to the city), and because the lack of a united identity contrasts with the emergence of Greek identity, culture and the conception of the *polis*.   The Greeks incorporated their overseas colonies into their conception of Greater Hellas,  and those trading centers lucky enough to both tap into trade routes and overlook fertile land became *polis'* of their own - city-states whose Greek-speaking citizens were awarded recognition and rights. And while many Greek mother-cities were exploitive towards their colonies, they were nowhere near so much as Tyre, Sidon and Byblos. For the Phoenician city-states, colonies existed only as an aspect of of the trading network, vital as they may have been. Those differing conceptions of the colonies would, however, conversely affect their relationships with the indigenous populations.   While Carthage would later develop   aggressive land-grabbing policies in Africa and Spain, the initial Phoenician traders had almost universally peaceful interactions with their neighbors. To risk disrupting trade would risk upsetting the delicate balance of their political organism. The presence of Greeks, however, accompanied the eradication of nearby natives  in mainland Italy, Sardinia and Sicily (then called *Magna Graeca* due to its large Greek population and powerful city-states); the polis had a both ideological and strategic interest in self-sufficiency, even if it came at the expense of the previous tenants of their farmland. While Greeks *did*  also transmit their culture through peaceful means (Marseille was peacefully settled, and their Celtic neighbors in southern France were ravenous for Greek cultural products), they, unlike the Phoenicians, appear to have had a stronger appetite for ethnic conflict stemming from their binary conception of the world and its moral order: Greek v. Non-Greek, and unlike the Phoenicians, carried their martial traditions to their colonies.  In the late second half of the 1st millennium BCE, Tyre's exposure to violence and conquest at the hands of Assyria, Babylon, Persia and Macedonia would wreak havoc on its mercantile empire; Greece was spared conquest by all these save for Alexander, who, fortunately for them, was also ideologically invested in preserving Greek culture at home and evangelizing it abroad. A disastrous war in Sicily would result in the expulsion of Phoenicians from the Hellenistic sphere, and the infamous Punic Wars would remove the inheritor to their empire, the Carthaginians, from Spain and Africa and utterly erase the most powerful Phoenician city-state since Tyre."	human
195	It's not possible for me to say exactly which 75mm guns were used in specific actions: the Japanese fielded quite a few varieties.  The most common was the 'Type 38 improved', basically the main field gun of the German Army of the First World War. The 'Type 41', a mountain gun, was passed to the infantry and used the same ammunition on a very light carriage that broke down into six loads. This was not to be confused with the famous 70mm battalion gun that could be elevated to high trajectory... it is difficult to imagine this common weapon as being of any use against even a light tank.  There was additionally a 'Type 90' 75mm field gun, based on a French design, which supplemented the Krupp-derived weapon. It was difficult to maintain and was not much used in Burma according to the sources I have.  The 'Type 1' in my references is the 47mm anti tank gun: a perfectly viable weapon in the sort of fighting the Japanese did but always in very short supply. There is not much mention of its use in Burma.  As always, a lack of decent records and the tendency of soldiers to mis-identify and stereotype enemy equipment has to be taken into account. By 1943 the Japanese were having great difficulty in producing up to date weapons in reasonable numbers, and even more difficulty deploying them (even had they wanted to: many of the best weapons were retained for the final battle for the home islands).  My info is from *The Japanese War Machine*, Bison Books, relevant chapter by Ian Hogg. Also *Infantry Weapons of World War II* by the same author.	human
196	The best place to look for these is to look at the battles in the final year of the war, as that is when the tactics were (mostly) out of their purely experimental phase. Near to the end, we can see a focus more on stormtrooper tactics (go around the strongpoints, if possible), massed tank assaults, hurricane barrages (very rapid and intense artillery attacks so that you can still surprise the enemy), creeping barrages (longer, mobile barrages to prevent reinforcement and weaken more distant enemy positions), and a focus on air supremacy.	human

202	There's also a shared cultural component.   The two quotes above are from two famous writers: Rochefoucauld (in French) and Goethe (in German). This makes them quite a bit more recognizable than random sentences in either language.   The other sentence-length bits in *Sign of the Four* also follow this pattern--there's some Stendhal, left in French, at the beginning and a more Goethe at the end. The other foreign words and short phrases have pretty strong contextual cues and seem to be there to make Holmes seem clever. 	human

The Germans were not prepared to fight in such cold weather, and many had to resort to lining the inside of their clothes with newspaper. Hitler dismissed the need for winter uniforms even after request from officers in the field. The temperature also had an effect on the machinery. The Luftwaffe was almost entirely grounded sometimes due to weather conditions, while Soviet pilots had experience with cold air flight along with the luxury of intact runways. Having aerial superiority was important to their strategy. When the ground was wet, the Soviet T-34 tanks proved to have thicker tread, neutralizing some of the disadvantages in traction and displacement. When it was freezing, the T-34 could start without problem, whereas the Panzers often had to continue running overnight in order to work the morning of the following day. Finally, the Russian arms had cold weather lubricant which stayed fluid in the freezing cold, while the German arms did not.  The Germans also did not expect such fanatical resistance from the Soviet soldiers. They were under the impression that they only had to “kick in the door” so to say, and the Soviet structure would crumble. On the other side of the coin, the Russian peasants resorted to scorched earth tactics, amplifying the German problems of supply and exposure.  One could also wonder what the outcome would have been if Hitler had decided to listen to his commanders and continue pressuring toward Moscow.  While I can’t bring myself to answer whether or not Operation Barbarossa was flawed from the start, I figured all of this information applies to why it failed. It’s only “flawed” because it didn’t succeed. Things that cannot be accounted for often change events on a dime, and if even the smallest factor changed, the outcome could have been drastically different. 	human
205	Think of it this way:  These days we have physical laws encoded as mathematical equations (think Newton's Laws, the equivalence principle in relativity theory, etc...) which which we hold to be fundamental descriptions of physical reality (at least approximately, within acceptable error, e.g. Newtonian gravity compared to general relativity) .   However, back them they had no physics to speak of (it will take Newton' law of universal gravitation before astronomers could do better than when Aristotle said that different planets were made of different stuff which just wanted to be in a different places). So, there was no reason to think any given starting point in deriving a mathematical model should encapsulate reality more than any other.	human

207	"Idk if this is really allowed?  But I wanted to ask what you guys think of my simple, liberty taking explanation of why Caesar was, well, awesome, but also not a tyrant dictator douche like many think:  Caesar was essentially the Bernie Sanders of ancient Rome, but much cooler.  Let's skip over all his amazing victories and political intrigue and funny shit, and skip right to the civil war we all know.  First, he started it because he was essentially forced too by Pompey and the senate.  They told him to come to Rome to be arrested.  So he crossed the Rubicon with the 13th legion, famously saying ""The die is cast"" and starting the civil war.  Pompey fled to Greece and Caesar took Rome.  He marched to Spain and fucked up Pompey's men, then went to Greece.  Very nearly lost a battle to Pompey, then absolutely kicked his ass in the next, despite being outnumbered 2:1 in infantry and significantly in cav.  Pompey fled to Egypt and was assassinated by some idiot.  Caesar went to Egypt.  Rekt some idiot Ptolemy or w/e his name is and installed Cleopatra on the throne, proceeded to fuck her brains out and produce a child.  What a fucking boss.  Took a quick detour over to Anatolia and wooped some idiots ass who had the advantage.  It happened so quickly and in such a fast decisive battle he said ""I came, I saw, I conquered""  Now that you know he's a badass, let's move on to him not being the cunt everything thinks:  He pardoned nearly all of his enemies after defeating Pompey.  He did NOT proscribe anyone like Sulla did (Proscribe = legalized murder).  He made a new will upon returning to Rome, and left a SUBSTANTIAL amount of money to the general citizens of Rome. He did NOT want to turn Rome into a dictatorship, or BE ONE... his goal was to fix the republic, bring order and balance to his new empi-- ok I'm joking but it's true.  The republic had become corrupt, the provinces were too powerful under the Governors who had absolute authority.  He wanted to supress armed rebels, stabalize the republic, fix the central Government (Centralize it, give it real power) and basically get rid of the province system.  He needed to be a dictator to do those things, we all know how effective democracies are at reforms that get rid of corruption...  He fixed a lot of issues Rome had been having for a LONG time.  He made a lot of reforms, regarding land and rebuilding cities, gave rights to people throughout Rome, abolished the tax system (it was dumb) and created a police unit.  The first time he was declared dictator he resigned in TWO WEEKS.  He was later appointed dictator for life, and at some point 10 years, I'm confused still on that part. Also, months before his assassination he resigned his role as the ONLY Consul and started an election of two successors, and restored the constition, though he was still dictator (That was a constitutional power legally given to him) So while he may have stayed Dictator for life he did it as a one time thing, he left no succcessor to it because he didn't want one.  He simply wanted to be in power to restore the republic, fix it, pass reforms.  He didn't want it to abuse power or anything, though that comes with the job.  I hope you all enjoyed my little essay about Julius Caesar  thank"	human
208	"(1/2)  The subject of black pirates is very tenuous and very fraught with misconceptions and romanticizations, but there are a very few indications and cases where it really may have been or certainly was the case. One individual in particular that stands out is a mixed-race buccaneer who called himself Diego el Mulatto (among many other titles) as he terrorized his way across the Spanish Main for much of the 17th century. He was called Diego Lucifer by the Spanish and he commanded a crew of predominantly white Dutchmen.   Diego's full name was probably Diego Martín and he was probably born in about the year 1610 or a few years earlier in Havana, Cuba. He was born to a white Spanish father and a black mother who was doubtless a slave but may have later been freed. Diego seems to have been brought up as his father's legitimate son, but at some point while he was still a minor his father died and he was taken to the town of Campeche in Mexico by his Spanish godfather. His godfather was named Domingo Galván Romero and was the captain of the town's garrison.   At some point while in Campeche, something happened and Diego had a terrible falling out with a Spanish officer named Domingo Rodriguez Calvo. According to the account of Thomas Gage who was an English Dominican priest later captured by Diego, Diego was ""most injuriously and wrongly abused, yea and (as I was afterwards informed) whipped him in the Havana."" What caused this is unknown and can only be wildly speculated. As a mulatto, Diego would have doubtless faced discrimination and perhaps he tried to claim his father's inheritance but was denied or some such.   At any rate, after this incident Diego fled Havana in a small boat with a small gang of companions intending to become pirates. On the coast of Cuba, they quickly came across Dutch privateers possibly led by Hendrick ""Lucifer"" Jacobszoon and fell in with them. It so happens that Hendrick ""Lucifer"" was killed in 1627 while capturing several Spanish galleons off the coast of Cuba and a year later the Dutch privateer fleet commanded by Piet Hein and Witte de With captured and plundered almost an entire Spanish treasure fleet off the coast of Cuba. This coincided almost exactly with the time that Diego escaped from Havana and joined them, and it's very possible that he proved himself to be very brave and competent and a good leader in these engagements. Something like that must have happened since within just a few years Diego was given personal command of not one but two Dutch ships as a privateer. It has been speculated that Diego may have been taken under Hendrick Lucifer's wing somehow before he died and this may help explain his speedy rise and his own later adoption of ""Lucifer"" as a moniker. Benerson Little writes:   &gt; Diego's crews were predominantly Dutch, but doubtless included the usual mix of English, French, Portuguese, Africans, mulattos, mestizos, and Native Americans, yet they took orders from him and were proud to serve under him. Pirates had an often hypocritical way of looking at race. They would accept some Africans into their crews, for example, yet sell other Africans as slaves. But above all, they valued the courage and ability that led to plunder. And Diego new how to lead his crews there.  By 1633, Diego captained his two ships in consort with the Dutch privateer Cornelis ""*Houtebeen*"" (wooden leg)"" Jol and together they attacked Campeche. One can speculate that Diego suggested this target not only because of his familiarity with the town but because of his bitter grudge against Domingo Rodriguez Calvo and possibly his godfather Domingo Galván Romero, who both were still living there. The buccaneers attacked in the early morning of August 11th, and Diego's godfather who was the captain of the local garrison led the town's defense but was killed in the fighting and the town was quickly overrun. Many of the town's inhabitants managed to flee and take refuge inland, including Diego's old enemy Domingo Rodriguez Calvo. Diego is reported to have searched madly for Calvo swearing that he would ""cut Rodriguez's ears and nose, but not kill him."" When Calvo and the other officials refused to pay the 40,000 Spanish dollars demanded as ransom for the town and prisoners (equivalent to about $2 million today), Diego and Cornelis Jol torched the town and released the prisoners some miles up the coast.   A year later, in 1634, Diego accompanied Dutch and French privateers in their capture of the Caribbean islands of Curacao and Aruba which then became Dutch colonies and bases of privateering. At some point around this time Diego also took a Dutch wife.   In 1636, Diego captured Dona Isabel de Caraveo, the widow of the Spanish governor of Yucatan while sailing in the Gulf of Campeche. Here Diego showed that he was capable of chivalry despite his fearsome reputation for when he learned there was a lady onboard and who she was, he apparently ordered that she be freed, all her goods returned to her and then taken aboard his own ship to ensure her security. Soon he put Dona Isabela and her retinue safely ashore on a beach on the coast of Campeche. From other accounts known of Diego's personality, this seems to fit. Another reason he did it may have been to gain the trust of the Spaniards.   One of the most revealing accounts of Diego el Mulatto comes from the English Dominican priest Thomas Gage (in the employ of the Spanish) whose ship was captured by him in 1637. Gage writes:   &gt; My further thoughts were soon interrupted by the Hollanders who came abord our Frigat with more speech then we desired. Though their Swords, Muskets and Pistols did not a little terrifie, yet we were somewhat comforted when we understood who was their chief Captain and Commander, and hoped for mercy from him, who had been born and brought up amongst the Spaniards, then from the Hollanders, ... The Captain of this Holland ship which took us was a Mulatto, born and bred in Havana, whose mother I saw and spoke with that same year, when the Galeons struck into that Port ... This Mulatto for some wrongs which had been offered unto him from some commanding Spaniards in the Havana, ventured himself desperately in a boat out to the Sea, where were some Holland Ships waiting for a prize, and with Gods help getting unto them, yielded himself to their mercy, which he esteemed far better then that of his own Countrymen, promising to serve them faithfully against his own Nation, which had most injuriously and wrongly abused, yea and (as I was afterwards informed) whipped him in the Havana.  &gt; This Mulatto proved so true and faithful in his good services unto the Hollanders, that they esteemed much of him, married him to one of their Nation, and made him Captain of a ship under that brave and gallant Hollander whom the Spaniards then so much feared, and named, Pie de Palo, or Wooden Leg. This famous Mulatto it was that with his Sea Soldiers borded our Frigat.... (Gage, 428)   Gage goes on to recount how Diego robbed about 7,000 pieces of eight worth of money and good from him (something like $350,000 today) which was the small fortune he had amassed during all of ten years spent working for the Spanish as a Dominican priest in Mexico. When the much aggrieved Gage protested, Diego replied ""Oy per mi, manana per ti"" or ""Today for me, tomorrow for you."" He, however, returned to Gage his books, paintings, blankets and clothes. Diego and his crew then set about rummaging the ship for food to eat and ""the good Captain made a stately dinner in our Frigat, and invited me unto it."" They then dined together and when he learned Gage was sailing to Havana he drank a toast to his mother asked Gage to tell her to ""remember him unto her, and how that for her sake he had used me well and courteously in what he could; and further at Table he said that for my sake he would give us our Frigat that we might return again [to Spain].""   After dinner, Gage secretly told Diego that he wasn't a Spaniard but an Englishman and tried to use this to argue he should be given his money back, but Diego ""told me I must suffer with those amongst whom I was found, and that I might as well claim all the goods in the ship for mine."" Gage then tried to get Diego to take him with him to Holland or England which Diego ""also refused to do, telling me that he went about from one place to another, and knew not when he should go to Holland, and that he was ready to fight with any Spanish ship, and if he should fight with the Spaniards whilst I was in his ship, his soldiers in their hot blood might be ready to do me a mischief"" (Gage, 430).

209	"(2/2)  Other accounts of Diego's personality mention him playing the guitar to entertain his crew as well as a curious sense of humor and an inclination to trickery (Little, 79). In 1634 when sailing with the Dutch privateer Adrian Clas, Diego dressed up as a Spanish prisoner and struck up a conversation with one of Clas' prisoners, the captain of a recently captured Spanish ship. Only later did he reveal who he was. This ruse also may have been done to gather intelligence. In 1638, Diego seems to have resorted to trickery again when he sent a letter to the governor of Cuba and identifying himself as Diego Martín, the mulatto privateer. He declared he was finally ready to switch his allegiance and serve Spain. So eager were the Spanish to be rid of him that they offered not only a pardon but to make him admiral and pay him eight *escudos* a month (something like $8,000). Instead of accepting this, however, Diego used this to distract and waste the governor's time while he raided the coasts of Honduras.   By the early 1640s, the Spanish had issued a royal edict that ""every possible remedy be taken to capture the mulatto pirate."" In 1641, Diego sacked more towns on the coast of Honduras, and in 1642, he sacked Campeche for a second time. It is unknown whether he finally got his revenge on Domingo Rodriguez Calvo. In 1643, he sacked another town on the coast of Honduras and joined forces with the English buccaneer William Jackson.   However, after this point, Diego's trail goes dark. There is scarcely any record of his activities from the mid-1640s until the 1660s. Perhaps he settled down somewhere like the Dutch island of Curacao he had helped to capture ten years earlier and used his stolen wealth raise a family. It is not known, but the first new record of Diego appears again only almost twenty years later in connection with the French buccaneer Francois l'Olonnais and then in 1668 as the ""Pirate of Campeche"" who accompanied the English buccaneer Henry Morgan on his raid against Portobello. Two years later, in 1670, he appears as captain of the *St. Jean* with eighty men as part of Henry Morgan's 1671 attack on Panama. In 1673, he is listed again as Diego Grillo. This long gap between Diego's disappearance from the record and then reemergence has led some to speculate that this was a different mulatto pirate, but the pirate historian Benerson Little disagrees and this is further strengthened by the fact that the man known as Diego el Mulatto used many various names throughout his career which may have even been part of his sense of humor:  &gt; His name was Diego, but he was known over his life by several names, including Diego the Mulatto, Diego de los Reyes, Captain Diego Martín, Diego de la Cruz, Diego le Metis, and, many years later, Diego Grillo. ... he was known by another named as well: Diego Lucifer. ...  &gt; ...  &gt; Indeed, it is quite likely that Diego himself coined many of the names he was known by, simply out of his sense of humor. At Yucatan he called himself Diego de la Cruz. To Captain de Tartas he was Diego de los Reyes. And to the governor of Havana he was Diego Martín, which may have been his real name, given his mother still lived in Havana and this was doubtless known to many. The fact that he consistently used the name Diego suggests his sense of humor. If he had been changing his name solely to create confusion, he could have used any variety of names. But he always used Diego, a name common enough to not make the joke too obvious. We can imagine his laughter at the consternation he surely created among Spanish governors, coastal inhabitants, and pirate hunters. In fact, part of his modern legacy is the confusion among many historians as to how many Diego the Mulatto pirates there really were. Quite likely Diego, best known as ""Captain Diego"" among those with whom he sailed, would be laughing just as hard now.   To those who object that Diego would have been too old to still be a buccaneer in 1673 when he must have been in his early 60s, there are other examples of nearly as long careers, including the Dutch buccaneer Willem Blauveldt who Diego would have interacted with who was active from the early 1630s until at least 1663 when he was recorded at yet another sack of Campeche. Another old buccaneer was claimed to have been in his 80s when he died at sea (Little, 82).  Anyway, by 1673, Diego el Mulatto, now known as Diego Grillo, had settled in the French pirate base of Tortuga where he continued to attack the Spanish. The political situation in the Caribbean had changed much since Diego began his career in the 1630s, and after 1671 when England signed a peace treaty with Spain, buccaneers no longer received much of the tacit support from local governors they once had, although French governors still usually turned a blind eye. This made Diego an enemy of the English as well as the Spanish. In June 1673, he captured a Spanish merchant sailing from Havana to Campeche, and in response three Spanish ships with 150 men were dispatched from Havana to hunt him down. They found him. Benerson Little writes:  &gt; The old pirate engaged them with his fifteen-gun frigate. The details of the fight are lacking, but almost certainly Diego attacked at close range, 100 yards (91.5km) or less, using his great guns to shatter timbers, shred rigging, and slaughter men, while his musketeers blazed away, forcing Spanish gunners and *arcabuseros* to keep their heads down. Diego captured at least one of the vessels, and some say all three--and hanged the twenty Spaniards aboard who were born in Spain. The rest he set free.  &gt; Perhaps Diego still nursed his ancient grudge, and now blamed all ""Old Spain men"" for the dishonor done to him. It is hard to avoid the possibility that Diego was in some way making a social or political statement, even if he hanged the Spaniards because he knew they intended to hang him immediately from the yardarm. Pirates were known to sometimes hang those who came to hang them.  Diego's success had almost run its course, however, as about two months later his consort, the Dutch buccaneer Jan Lucas, was captured on the coast of Campeche and hanged. Without providing any details, several secondary sources say that Diego himself was captured and hung soon after. Recalling his quote in response to Thomas Gage after robbing his money in 1637--today for me, tomorrow for you--Little writes:  &gt; Whatever his end, tomorrow did finally come for the noble and ""much esteemed"" Captain Diego, cutthroat pirate and gentleman privateer.   **Sources:**  *How History's Greatest Pirates Pillaged, Plundered, and Got Away With It* by Benerson Little   *A new survey of the West-Indies: or, The English American his travel by sea and land* by Thomas Gage, published 1648"	human

211	"**The Three Campaigns of 1355**  There were nominally three campaigns planned for 1355: the first was to be lead by the Earl of Lancaster, and would target Normandy, the second was initially to be lead by the Earl of Warwick but was then placed under the command of the Black Prince and was aimed at Gascony, while the third was to be lead by King Edward himself and would strike out from the port city of Calais to devastate the French countryside. Clifford Rogers has argued that there were only two planned expeditions and that Lancaster's expedition was one proposed following Navarre's defection to the French but not actually followed up. Regardless, there were at least two armies competing for resources, and this included men. As the Black Prince's expedition is the best documented of the two, I'll be using it as a case study.  I think it's important to note here that we have comparatively little evidence of the occupations and practice of archery in the English countryside during this period. It's not until the Poll Taxes of 1377, 1379 and 1381 that we have sufficient records of names and occupations to match with records of service from muster rolls. We have some limited evidence from the surnames or the odd note in other muster rolls prior to this that give us some professions, but this offers a very incomplete picture. The currently published Muster Rolls that I'm aware of also almost all refer to towns, rather than the countryside from which most archers were drawn.  As a result, I'm going to be using some works that aren't necessarily representative of the situation in 1355. I'll be using my best judgement when discussing and drawing conclusions from them, but it will be informed speculation only.   **Recruiting for the Black Prince's Expedition**  The question of why you would choose to serve in the Prince's expedition to Gascony requires first that we establish who was enlisting. This is pretty tricky for the most part, but there is nonetheless one group we can identify with ease: the criminals.  It had been standard practice for some time for those wanted for murder or some other major crime to serve the King in return for a pardon. While some pardons were granted prior to service, most were granted only after the service was complete, likely to avoid desertion. While it might seem like an easy ride, those serving in return for a pardon were almost never paid a wage and had to pay a fee after the campaign to receive their pardon. Although no source I have discusses it, they were probably armed at the expense of the Crown and this equipment would have been returned once their service was complete. As such, those serving in exchange for pardons relied entirely on loot to make their service worthwhile. As a risk, though, it was probably better than immediate execution or a long prison sentence. Of the 890 served in the Prince's campaign that we can positively identify, almost 180 men were serving in exchange for a pardon, or about 7-8% of the total English force.  Of the remainder, we know that 300 of the ""best and most skillful archers"" were to be raised in Cheshire by means of a Commission of Array, along with another 100 of the ""best and most skillful archers that can be found in the county"". These latter were probably recruited via an indenture to serve directly under the Prince and would have already had their equipment or be in a position to obtain it themselves, thus making them relatively wealthy. A further 100 archers were to be raised from Flintshire, while 140 men from North Wales were also to be raised (these may not have been archers - their role is not specified and North Wales was known for their spearmen).  In all probability, only the archers from Cheshire served as mounted archers, as they received pay of 6d per day as opposed to the 3d per day of the men from Flintshire and Wales. Precisely how the 300 men summoned by Commissions of Array received their mount is unknown. Perhaps the lower number of men demanded from the shire allowed the communities to afford to purchase a horse for the man demanded from their area, or perhaps the commissioners deliberately chose those who could afford to purchase a horse and that this was part of a criteria that has not survived or was unwritten. Not all of those chosen would have served - it was permissible for a man to pay another to serve in his stead, and this may have included the provision of a horse, helmet and sword to supplement the required bow and arrows of a poorer man.  How the retinues of the other lords who served were recruited is unknown. Commissions of Array are unlikely, as Cheshire was a county palatine and the Prince was the heir, giving him the support of the king in this regard. We do know that some Cheshire archers joined retinues of other lords, in spite of this being forbidden without the Prince's permission until he had gathered a sufficient number of archers. Indentures, that is, contracts for military service, are the more likely method.  It's also unlikely that the other lords recruited predominantly from areas around them. In the late 14th century, lords did not recruit most of their men from their home county, having between 7% and 23% of their total force made up of these men. As evidenced by the Cheshire archers joining other retinues, this seems the case here as well. The Prince was almost certainly alone in his desire and ability to recruit men form his home counties. The other captains would have hired anyone willing to serve, though at least some part of their retinue would be made up of archers from their lands or counties. Many of these would have been servants who performed some other, primary, task when not on campaign, while others would be tenants or free tenants from their lands.  Now we come to the question of who volunteered for service. Samuel Gibbs' thesis provides the best analysis for the late 14th century, though it has its limits. Frustratingly, the Poll Tax records for Cheshire and Flintshire appear to be largely lacking and heavily weighted towards towns. As a result, there is a bias towards artisans. Overall, for England, archers in the standardised ""laborer"", ""servant"" and tenant"" categories were most frequently the largest proportion of the archers. Wage laborers were most common in areas where there was a high population density, limited good quality land and close links to a major town or city, such as Wessex or Sussex. Areas with lower population densities, such as the Dorset region, had a larger proportion of tenant farmers as archers.   In terms of general economic status, those employed in retinues of lords from their county were of a generally middling sort - not as poor as the poorest, but not as rich as the richest peasants. The economically motivated archers, serving in retinues outside of their county, had more of a spread. They featured some in the lowest and highest brackets for peasants, with less grouped around the middle range. This suggests a wider range of economic backgrounds and that some of the poorer may have had their equipment provided or might have taken out loans to afford it. While we mostly hear about loans taken out by men-at-arms, knights and lords or retinue captains, credit was available to villagers within their own village or in the wider area around their village. Most of these were small loans, under 40 shillings, but as an archers only needed 26 shillings to meet minimum requirements for the mid-14th century mounted archers, this was within the range for loans given by fellow peasants. The promise of loot or saved wages to repay the debt would have made it an attractive option for those in the poorer levels of society.  (cont.)"	human
212	(2/2)  **Why Men Joined**  Now that we've made a tentative identification of those serving as those of middling wealth, mostly servants, wage laborers or tenants, we can look at why men might have joined. Two of the biggest factors are the wages and the loot.  At this time, after the Black Death, those most likely to serve would have been earning around 4d per day, but not 4d every day. Between Sundays, Holy Days (holidays) and other festivals, there was between 90 and 100 days per year when a laborer or servant couldn't work and would be paid. How often this was broken we don't know, but there is good evidence that work stopped on these days on a lord's land and major building sites. A man working as an archer, however, would be paid every day he count function as one. They mostly weren't paid if sick or otherwise not present at a roll call (except if on some kind of official business), but otherwise they were paid on Sundays, Holy Days and festival days. The attraction wasn't just the higher wage (feeding at least one horse would eat into the extra wage in any case), but the consistency of it. An archer, if contracted for a year, could earn almost £10, as much as the minimum income requirements to serve as a man-at-arms. Even if they were only paid for 60 days of service, they would earn as much money as they could in four months working their usual jobs.  As /u/sunagainstgold has mentioned, wages were almost always in arrears (often by ten years), but generally half of it would be paid up front in this period, and the captain in charge of the archers would be likely to borrow money to pay them. Ultimately, it was those who led retinues who waited the longest to be paid, though doubtless there were long periods where archers weren't paid and they might not have gotten their full wages for some time after the campaign ended.  Loot was a less predictably, yet more likely source of wealth. Although much of a chevauchée involved the destruction of villages, this was done on a truly massive scale, and even in a poor village there were items of worth. Pots, clothes, spindles, ploughs, livestock, looms and all manner of every day items had real value and could be resold. Edward III, during his Crecy campaign, sent whole boatloads filled with these goods back to England, and three small to middling towns were sacked in addition to Caen, which was quite a large town. In the 1355 Poitiers campaign, which we're speaking of, three towns and the suburbs of another were sacked and the loot accumulated was so great that it slowed the return march noticeably. And, as /u/sunagainstgold has noted, churches were a good source of loot.  There are lesser reasons for service as well. Those with debts might chose to serve in order to receive protection from all debts until they returned (this would tie in with their hope of loot and good pay), while others might choose to leave for revenge. The French and English had been raiding each other's coasts, and those on the coast might wish revenge for French piracy. Others might have served out of a sense of loyalty to their local lord or because another family member was serving - there's good evidence that less wealthy or younger members of a family might serve as the archer to a wealthier or older family member on campaign. Others, meanwhile, probably served because they were young and wanted to participate in a victory such as Crecy.  On the whole, though, the pay and the loot seem most likely to be the major reasons why someone would take the risk and serve in an English army intent on firing France from one end to the other.  **Bibliography**  *The Black Prince at War: The Anatomy of a Chevauchée*, by Mollie Marie Madden (unpublished PhD Thesis)  *War Cruel and Sharp*, by Clifford Rogers  *The service patterns and socialeconomic status of English archers, 1367-1417: The evidence of the muster rolls and poll tax returns*, by Samuel Gibbs (unpublished PhD Thesis)  *Arrowstorm*, by Richard Wadge  *The Black Prince's Expedition*, by H.J.

In 1643, he sacked another town on the coast of Honduras and joined forces with the English buccaneer William Jackson.   However, after this point, Diego's trail goes dark. There is scarcely any record of his activities from the mid-1640s until the 1660s. Perhaps he settled down somewhere like the Dutch island of Curacao he had helped to capture ten years earlier and used his stolen wealth raise a family. It is not known, but the first new record of Diego appears again only almost twenty years later in connection with the French buccaneer Francois l'Olonnais and then in 1668 as the ""Pirate of Campeche"" who accompanied the English buccaneer Henry Morgan on his raid against Portobello. Two years later, in 1670, he appears as captain of the *St. Jean* with eighty men as part of Henry Morgan's 1671 attack on Panama. In 1673, he is listed again as Diego Grillo. This long gap between Diego's disappearance from the record and then reemergence has led some to speculate that this was a different mulatto pirate, but the pirate historian Benerson Little disagrees and this is further strengthened by the fact that the man known as Diego el Mulatto used many various names throughout his career which may have even been part of his sense of humor:  &gt; His name was Diego, but he was known over his life by several names, including Diego the Mulatto, Diego de los Reyes, Captain Diego Martín, Diego de la Cruz, Diego le Metis, and, many years later, Diego Grillo. ... he was known by another named as well: Diego Lucifer. ...  &gt; ...  &gt; Indeed, it is quite likely that Diego himself coined many of the names he was known by, simply out of his sense of humor. At Yucatan he called himself Diego de la Cruz. To Captain de Tartas he was Diego de los Reyes. And to the governor of Havana he was Diego Martín, which may have been his real name, given his mother still lived in Havana and this was doubtless known to many. The fact that he consistently used the name Diego suggests his sense of humor. If he had been changing his name solely to create confusion, he could have used any variety of names. But he always used Diego, a name common enough to not make the joke too obvious. We can imagine his laughter at the consternation he surely created among Spanish governors, coastal inhabitants, and pirate hunters. In fact, part of his modern legacy is the confusion among many historians as to how many Diego the Mulatto pirates there really were. Quite likely Diego, best known as ""Captain Diego"" among those with whom he sailed, would be laughing just as hard now.   To those who object that Diego would have been too old to still be a buccaneer in 1673 when he must have been in his early 60s, there are other examples of nearly as long careers, including the Dutch buccaneer Willem Blauveldt who Diego would have interacted with who was active from the early 1630s until at least 1663 when he was recorded at yet another sack of Campeche. Another old buccaneer was claimed to have been in his 80s when he died at sea (Little, 82).  Anyway, by 1673, Diego el Mulatto, now known as Diego Grillo, had settled in the French pirate base of Tortuga where he continued to attack the Spanish. The political situation in the Caribbean had changed much since Diego began his career in the 1630s, and after 1671 when England signed a peace treaty with Spain, buccaneers no longer received much of the tacit support from local governors they once had, although French governors still usually turned a blind eye. This made Diego an enemy of the English as well as the Spanish. In June 1673, he captured a Spanish merchant sailing from Havana to Campeche, and in response three Spanish ships with 150 men were dispatched from Havana to hunt him down. They found him. Benerson Little writes:  &gt; The old pirate engaged them with his fifteen-gun frigate. The details of the fight are lacking, but almost certainly Diego attacked at close range, 100 yards (91.5km) or less, using his great guns to shatter timbers, shred rigging, and slaughter men, while his musketeers blazed away, forcing Spanish gunners and *arcabuseros* to keep their heads down. Diego captured at least one of the vessels, and some say all three--and hanged the twenty Spaniards aboard who were born in Spain. The rest he set free.  &gt; Perhaps Diego still nursed his ancient grudge, and now blamed all ""Old Spain men"" for the dishonor done to him. It is hard to avoid the possibility that Diego was in some way making a social or political statement, even if he hanged the Spaniards because he knew they intended to hang him immediately from the yardarm. Pirates were known to sometimes hang those who came to hang them.  Diego's success had almost run its course, however, as about two months later his consort, the Dutch buccaneer Jan Lucas, was captured on the coast of Campeche and hanged. Without providing any details, several secondary sources say that Diego himself was captured and hung soon after. Recalling his quote in response to Thomas Gage after robbing him in 1637--""Today for me, tomorrow for you""--Little writes:  &gt; Whatever his end, tomorrow did finally come for the noble and ""much esteemed"" Captain Diego, cutthroat pirate and gentleman privateer.   **Sources:**  *How History's Greatest Pirates Pillaged, Plundered, and Got Away With It* by Benerson Little   [*A new survey of the West-Indies: or, The English American his travel by sea and land*](https://archive.org/details/newsurveyofwesti01gage) by Thomas Gage, published 1648"	human
214	Not all of England would have actually followed the Statute of Westminster. Richard Wadge has shown that there is very little evidence of archers in the southern counties and, even in 1355, only 17.5% of men at Norwich had bows, fewer even than those who had armour. Over three times as many only had a cudgel and knife or, in 1/3 of these cases, a spear, axe or sword in addition to the cudgel and knife.  By contrast, the northern counties and those bordering Wales (or who traditionally sent men off to Wales or Scotland i.e. Nottingham and London) appear to have large numbers of archers. It probably wasn't until the 1363 proclamation that archery became common in the southern counties.	human

216	"I can't comment on your analysis of Phoenician settlement, but your notion of Greek overseas settlement here is very outdated. The argument that the process of settlement was driven by overpopulation has long been refuted; there is no evidence of such population pressure in the period of most intensive Greek foundation activity (for example, marginal ground within the home territory of most Greek states doesn't become occupied until the late 6th century BC). Much Greek overseas settlement predated the formation of clearly defined *polis* institutions in Greece, and newly founded communities likely helped to create those institutions rather than being created as carbon copies of Greek practices at home. In this early period there is absolutely no ""exploitation"" of ""colonies"" by mother cities; new settlements were wholly autonomous communities that created their own laws and customs and had no formal obligations towards the states that claimed to have founded them. You might be interested in my recent answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7p8h79/when_people_think_of_colonisation_they_typically/dsfwy88/) which provides a more up-to-date assessment of Greek ""colonization""."	human

218	"Emotions and cruelty were certainly factors in *individual cases* of decisions to torture someone in the later Middle Ages--not so different than today, whatever our ""knowledge."" But in theory, medieval people were skeptical of the utility of torture.  First, although the practice is well-attested in antiquity, pre-judicial (as opposed to punitive) torture is completely invisible in medieval sources until the thirteenth century. Scholars have linked this period, and its decline, to the trial by ordeal. In theory, trial by ordeal meant that *God* was the ultimate judge. Any proof obtained by human hands, including through torture, could never measure up to the definitive evidence proffered by ""God"" in the ordeal's outcome. (Side note: Medieval historians have generally concluded that trial by ordeal was actually a way for pre-existing community sentiment on a case to come to the foreground and gain legal legitimacy)  But while this shows a certain skepticism for the so-called Dark Ages, it doesn't say very good things for the period after *Ad extirpanda* and the other 13th century legitimizations of inquisitional torture. Nevertheless, it's clear that in rational, considered moments, medieval people remained aware of torture's limited utility--with the key in most cases being ""limited,"" not ""nonexistent."" So, second: torture was only to be used, officially, to confirm guilt that was already known. It could not *establish* guilt in and of itself. This utilized the later medieval legal principle known as *fama*, which also means reputation or rumour. This was ""what is known"" about a person within their community--their reputation, but also gossip about their actions *that was understood/accepted to be true.* According to ecclesiastical inquisitors, only when a person's *fama* already help the true could an inquisition of the suspect, including in extreme cases torture, be applied. (You'll recognize an easy parallel to the role of the community in judging trials by ordeal, by proxy; here the judgment happens *before* any trial).  Third, confessions under torture were not technically sufficient legal proof. Inquisitors were required to obtain a repeat of the confession *not* under torture. On one hand, you've probably found the obvious flaw already: surely people would repeat their confession to avoid being tortured *again*, starting over. And there is of course a certain extent to which this is true; retractions after torture was finished are an endemic part of medieval trial records (the condemnation of the Templars being the obvious illustration). And yes, judges might indeed pay attention. In 1323, Niccolo Bandi of Parma (Italy) was charged with a series of five robberies, all of which he confessed to under torture. In court the next day, on the other hand, his defense was that he had indeed committed *one* burglary, because he was drunk and out of his wits, but the other ones he had confessed to ""by error and by torture"". One versus five was a monumentous distinction; it meant the difference between a punishment of public shame on one hand, and execution on the other. And in the end, the court accepted Bandi's claim that torture had extracted a false confession!  Overall, the need for confirmation/repetition of confession shows a lack of wholehearted confidence in the ability to torture to produce unassailable proof, even if there was still heavy coercion tilting towards a repeated confession.  Finally, yes, there are actually plenty of cases of individuals or groups explicitly asserting the superiority of evidence/proof acquired without torture. Towards the end of the Middle Ages/into the Reformation era, groups denounced as heretical by the Church began assembling lists of their own beliefs (known, of course, as ""confessions""--think the Lutherans' Confession of Augsburg as an orthodox/mainstream example). Several of these insist something along the lines of ""these are our beliefs freely given, not under torture"" (since inquisitors had a way of extracting whatever set of heretical beliefs they wanted to hear--witchcraft stereotypes beng a akey example).  Many of the most famous denunciations come from England. John Fortescue of Glouchestershire (d. 1479) was chief justice and MP under Henry VI and Edward IV. In his legal treatise *De laudibus legum angliae*, he did not merely assert that confessions obtained by torture were invalid because they were extracted ""not because of truth, but only because of irresistible torments."" He stressed the importance of *certainty* in confession, which could never be obtained with torture given that element of doubt in there--and used this demand for certainty, which we've seen above as the need for unassailable proof, as a reason that the English system of prohibiting torture was superior to all the continental legal systems!  So yes, even though the coming witchcraft accusations and executions would depend so strongly on false confessions dragged out under torture, medieval people expressed *and practiced* their skepticism of its validity, though they did not reject it entirely."	human

220	"The ""improvised synthesis of methamphetamine"" first crops up in the US during the 60s and 70s though it's history is older.  Meth in that period was prevalent in the west coast of the US and mostly the purview of outlaw biker gangs who were linked to other aspects of the drug trade. They used the ""California Cook"" or P2P method. These were the first ""clan labs"" associated with meth production in the US and they were very dangerous.  The production quality of the P2P method is also pretty inefficient and the resulting meth is usually of lower grade than other methods.  In the 80s and 90s, the ""Nazi Cold Cook"" method took off, and it used anhydrous ammonia and ephedrine, mainly acquired through theft of farm supplies and large scale purchases of over the counter ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  That became the predominant ""clan lab"" in the US, into the early 2000s. It started to lose popularity as the DEA and states tightened the sale of ephedrine/Sudofed and fertilizer suppliers and users made it harder to steal or acquire anhydrous ammonia. The early 2000s also saw a major shift in meth supplies from internal to the US to Mexico as ""home cookers"" ceased to be the main source for meth in the black drugs market. It was more efficient and cheaper to smuggle industrial scale produced meth across the border. In a way, the enforcement activities that successfully reduced the number of clan labs in the US, led to a ""professionalization"" and ""commoditization"" of the meth market.  The alternate form of production is the ""red P"" method you refer to (of which there are two primary variations). This has been around for a while and popped up in clan labs from time to time but was not as popular as the Cold Cook among home brewets. It is the primary production method used in Mexican labs, however.    Source: Long ago, in a land far away, I attended an abbreviated version of the DEA Clan Lab course and worked with a number of meth task forces, but since that might be seen as ""anecdotal"" by the ever vigilant  Moderators, I recommend you see this DOJ publication for a start: https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs13/13853/product.htm "	human

While he notes that the number of archers recorded in 1300-1360 muster rolls *was* lower than one might expect from the requirements, the percentage varied greatly--and not just by geography.

222	The strategic map of the the 17th century and the 30 years war era would be difficult to implement as it would require some serious changes to the existing system, further, and this is just my opinion, the amount of siege and positional warfare in the age of Vauban could also be seen as a bit of a departure from the traditional TW Series. There are elements of this in the Rome and Medieval series, but they don't truly capture the uniqueness of the 16th and 17th century. That isn't to say it couldn't be done, but my understanding of the history leads me to believe that the period would be difficult to adapt to the current TW game structure and system, without it sacrificing either the history for the purposes of game play, or the enjoyment of the game play for the sake of the history. I am sure others will disagree. 	human

It's like comparing the civil war and world war 2. Yes, there were guns and people called sergeants in both periods, but you can see how different they are.   It's also a setting thing.

224	"Thanks for the correction and the great write-up you did earlier. I enjoyed your point that ""colonization"" doesn't really capture the process as well as the original Greek; I've even heard it said by a particularly smitten Classicist that the English word ""Democracy"" should be thrown out and replaced, because it's a bastardization of the true meaning of the word. I wish I knew the Canaanite terms for ""colonization"" and ""trade"" well enough to understand what their own nuances can tell us about Phoenicia's expansion.   It's ironic that I just read a piece casting doubt on older theories of overpopulation instigating *Tyrian* immigration, theories which I'm pretty certain were  constructs based on -as you pointed out, outdated - models of Greek ""colonization"" due to a lack of archaeological evidence before the 9th century BCE, but didn't think to apply that to what I knew about Iron Age Greece. Also another reminder of the danger of trusting pop-history web-pages to fill in the gaps; all the earliest results when I was Googling to compare what I've read in *Phoenician and the West* with what's available on Greek settlements referred to both overpopulation and tributary relationships. I wouldn't be surprised if easily digestible, yet inaccurate, explanations like ""overpopulation and food insecurity"" have an easier time surviving in the ether than the more accurate explanation of ""there was limited state control to prevent groups from leaving, so they did,"" which leaves one needing to ask more questions to understand Ancient Greek cultural attitudes towards vast subjects like autonomy/independence, trade and religion that we as modern readers don't share.  It's also really interesting to hear that the mainland Greek city-states really only began encouraging the ""parent-child"" relationship once their former colonies had evolved into  powers of their own. Do you know if cities like Golden Age Athens (if I'm correct that Athens' Golden Age was also it's expansionist era) were the instigators of this shift? It would be interesting if the more predatory behavior towards fellow Greek states coincided with Athens as radical democracy, and one enthralled with it's own institutions, culture and history."	human
225	This will get deleted but it's a very simple answer to your question - that life expectancy is basically due to huge levels of infant mortality (children die before they turn 5). Once through childhood (and as a man, not having to deal with dangerous childbirth) men could be expected to reach 50/60/70 years old regularly.  Think of it as: out of 10 births, 5 die before the age of 5, 5 live to ~60. Average life span is 30, but in reality many people live far longer.  Hope this helps!	human
226	"Using Cassius Dio as a source, Nero had at least two long term relationships with freedmen (not slaves). One he treated like a woman, one he treated like a man.  Sporus was a boy that resembled Nero dead wife, Sabina (he had killed her with a kick while she was pregnant). He had Sporus ""castrated and used him in every way like a woman"".  Pythagoras was the other.  They actually had a marriage ceremony in Greece:  &gt; Now Nero called Sporus Sabina not merely on account of the fact that by reason of resemblance to her he had been made a eunuch, but because the boy like the mistress had been solemnly contracted to him in Greece, with Tigillinus to give the bride away, as the law ordained. All the Greeks held a festal celebration of their marriage, uttering all the customary good wishes (as they could not well help) even to the extent of praying that legitimate children might be born to them. After that Nero took to himself two bedfellows, Pythagoras to treat as a man and Sporus as a woman. The latter, in addition to other forms of address, was termed lady, queen, and mistress.  Form the Complete Works of Cassius Dio (Delphi Ancient Classics Book 36)  Of course after Nero reign his reputation was completely blackened, so at least some of this could well be propaganda.  Still, it is certainly true that Nero was in love with everything greek - that was one of the main accusations against him. So his following ""greek customs"" in this (or at least his interpretation) would have been in character."	human
227	The early modern period in Britain generally refers to 1500-1600s so I’m gonna go with that for my answer.  First of all, the early modern period saw the beginning of a significant change in the economic landscape. London (and other cities) broadened their commercial possibilities by no longer relying on the production of a few trade goods (in London’s case, wool). Increased population due primarily to an influx of migrant labor allowed for more specialization in the workforce among urban artisans. Expansion of state power in the period also opened the way for government officials and lawyers to join craftsmen in a growing middle class. Additionally, the realignment of trade towards the Atlantic seaboard made London more important for the fledgling merchant and banker classes of Europe.   Meanwhile, the aristocracy began moving in large part to the city, bringing large servant-filled estates with them. The spread of Renaissance humanism (thanks in large part to the printing press) took a strong hold among Britain’s aristocratic elite. Among the virtues of humanism were education (especially in the classics) and patronage of the arts. Suddenly the expectation among nobles was that they would be cultured and educated, a trait that was quite uncommon in the High Middle Ages and even Late Middle Ages to a somewhat lesser extent. As such, aristocrats were more likely to become patrons for artists and other artisans in the city, which fueled the enterprise therein.   London’s increased importance as an Atlantic port was only reinforced by the concurrent fall of Venice, whose relevance continually diminished due in large part to military defeat at the hands of the Ottoman Turks. Despite this, European trade did become even easier in the period, which heightened London’s economic influence even further.   As such, the humanist movement and the economic changes of the Renaissance were the most important factors in making the British elite more “enterprising”, both in terms of arts patronage and economic investment (especially since Atlantic trade investment had the possibility of far greater profits than Mediterranean trade ever offered).   TLDR; humanism makes aristocracy patronize art and recenter themselves on city. Growing cities create more economic opportunity. Atlantic trade is far more profitable than European, which leads to more investment from elites.   Let me know if you need anything else clarified/I missed something!

228	"I will admit to be at the edge of my knowledge here.  However,  I would guess that the fact that the difference between the models had persisted for at least a thousand years (the standard astronomy text, the ""Almagest"" was an ancient Greek treatise) would lend a certain sense of resignation to the situation.   This, combined with the alternatives being no better probably contributed to the state of affairs (note Copernicus' main contribution was the use of Arabic trigonometry, which made calculations quicker. Also, the heliocentric  model he used suffered from the same problems of circles on circles as the ptolomaic model; so his models suffered from this unpleasant dichotomy as well.)  So, ultimately this difference between models was probably viewed as an inescapable fact."	human

230	"It wasn't really a point as much of a process, and one without clear demarcation lines. Progressivism in the late 19 and early 20th century is usually associated with the Republicans, while the truth is, it was more diffuse politically. It is common to point to Nixon's southern strategy as a key turning point in the development of the modern Republican party, but that shift from blue to red in southern states was a 20 year process that didn't really cement in place until the early 90s.  The truth is, until the mid to late 90s, both the Republicans and Democrats were more diffuse in their ideology and had ""bigger tents"" with real middles. This not only formed the basis for any number of political compromises, but was also a key component of American foreign policy in the Cold War. There are any number of examples on both sides - from the Scoop Jackson wing of the Democrats (whose last members were probably Joe Liberman and Sam Nunn), to the old Northeastern ""country club"" wing of the Republican party.   The 90s to today have seen both parties solidify toward their extremist wings. There are any number of factors that contributed to this, the most commonly cited being big data's role in gerrymandering and the rise of talk radio and cable news, but neither of those is entirely adequate as an explanation as partisan media and gerymeandering have long histories in America. Political scientists are still coming to terms with things and there is no consensus. Yet, I believe, it is generally understood that the current  ideological fights largely emerged in the 60s and 70s (or at least echo them) and these form the underlying basis for the left/right divide of the present situation. The New Left took over the Democrats and the Goldwater Republicans (at least until 2016) took over the Republican party.   It may be better to look at the switch between ideologies as less of a switch and more of a big ""sorting"" process that began after WWII and ran into the 1990s, before accelerating over the last 20+ years, during which the middle was excluded from the process, (especially in the last 20 years) and certain ideological currents coelesced around the two ""poles"" of the present two party system.   There are both structural and socio-economic factors involved in this (among other factors) not all of them understood or agreed on, but the ""switch"" was more of a ""solidification"" around extant ideologies that were previously not exclusive to either party.   Incidentally, the current Republican party appears to be undergoing a split that echoes the 1850s (know nothing's bear a lot of resemblance to the Trump wing) with the Goldwater/Reagan legacy playing the role of the Whigs, while the Democrats are undergoing their own ideological divide between the older (Clinton) part of the party that is mainly ""conservative"" in that it seeks to prevent further diminishment of the social/welfare and societal changes it has implemented, and a younger (Bernie/Warren) wing that harkens back to the New Left and it's more radical elements.   There are any number of historians and political scientists that suggest that the current situation is not going to hold and we may be on the cusp of another major shakeup/re-alignment like that of the 19th Century that saw the emergence of the Republican party and death of the Whigs, along with a major shift in the immigrant vote from the pro-slavery Democrats to the abolitionist Republicans, especially in the Midwest German communities.   While that remains a possibility, the previous re-alignment also featured a civil war, so let's hope it goes more peaceful this time if that is the case."	human
231	"Curt Gentry in J. Edgar Hoover, the Man and his Secrets, along with several other scholars before and since have noted the FBI's use of illegal wiretaps and ""black bag"" operations likely benefited multiple Presidental administrations in that Hoover used information on political opponents of sitting Presidents to curry favor. There is some evidence to support these claims.   Further, so the argument goes, Nixon was keen for Hoover to do the same for him and he was more than well aware of Hoover's activities under Eisenhower and the Kennedy's use of any number of nefarious methods in the 1960 election for which he bore a powerful grudge. Hoover demurred. The story is that Nixon's aides convinced him to fire Hoover and install a new director that would play ball. Hoover was called to the oval office for a one on one meeting, where Nixon was supposed to fire him and ask for his resignation. At the conclusion of the meeting Nixon walked out with Hoover, told him he was doing a great job and to keep up the good work and that was that. Nixon's aides were stunned and Nixon never revealed what happened, supposedly that is also one of the ""missing"" parts of the Nixon tapes.   The real basis of Hoover's caution was more about cementing his legacy. The FBI, NSA, CIA and military intelligence were all up to no good in the 60s and 70s (hence the Church Committee) and Hoover didn't want to risk tarnishing his legacy if they got busted. His grip on power was ebbing and he was nearing the end of his life and knew it. It is hard to know for certain though, as he didn't exactly tell anyone who would repeat it (Tolson certainly knew). In any case, his refusal to play ball with Nixon led to the White House plumbers...and the rest is history."	human

236	I think you may have misinterprered that statistic. That 30 year figure is a measure of overall mortality and not adult lifespan.  It's worth noting that childhood mortality was extremely high prior to the 19th century with some estimates putting the chances of surviving into one's teenage years as low as 50%. What that means is that, when taking the average, you're including people who never made it to adulthood. Once someone made it to adulthood, it was  not uncommon for them to live comparably as long a life as many live today.

237	A major part of Prussia was then under Poland's control, and therefore the Polish kings were the official royalty there. Polish kings would take offense to someone else being called a king of one of the regions in their country, as it would undermine their authority over the region.  Which why Frederick the Great only became officially known as the King of Prussia after annexing Royal Prussia from Poland.	human

Other factors, such as the traditional usefulness of bows in medieval naval warfare (some 12th/13th century Norwegian laws require 1 bow for every two men), may also be at play, given that Hastings was a  Cinque Port responsible for providing men and ships to the Crown and occasionally engaging in piracy.	human

240	Using a contemporaneous historical anecdote to answer:  When Minuit bought the island of what is now New York, he purchased it for what was registered as $24 worth of trinkets. That corresponds to roughly $1,050 in today’s dollars.  That translates to roughly $35,000 in today’s money. Or a year’s salary for a common person in today’s economy.	human
241	I'm not a historian by any means, but surely it is a more complicated matter than just taking inflation into consideration. Wouldn't we need to also look at the purchasing power of then/now. 	human
242	The purchasing power of $779 back in 1639 would have gone a lot further than $35000 today. When we think of a salary today we usually immediately think of all the bills we have to pay to assign value to how much we make. Back in 1639 the cost of living was much simpler and there weren't nearly as many bills that had to be paid. I'd imagine $35000 could afford a few people's salaries. 	human

244	As /u/BlindPelican already mentioned, historical life expectancy values are usually skewed by high infant mortality. If you factor that out, you come to very different results.  In fact, Leonardos life span it seems was only slightly above the average age at death for Italian renaissance artists from Central and Northern Italy, which is apparently 64.05 years - I found this article in the *Lancet* that goes into a bit of detail on the age at death of Italian artists which I found so delightful that I had to comment here to share it with y'all:  https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-education/reprints/1975-Lancet-LifeExpectationOfItalianReneissanceArtists.pdf  The takeaway of this is not that Italian renaissance artists were much healthier or lived longer than the general population (many of them would have more amenities and better food available than the average peasant, though, and it seems that successful artists tended to live longer - or they could be more successful *because* they lived longer), but that to become an Italian renaissance artist, you would have to survive infancy, so this dataset nicely factors out high infant mortality.   This is true for other periods of history as well, studying ages at death of people from antiquity you will also find higher life expectancies after surviving infancy. Another bottleneck is childbirth, especially in young women, which also skews the numbers a bit, you will find a lot of dead women in their late teens and early 20s, but after that, their risk of death decreases until they reach old age again.	human
245	He was opposed to the revolution, and moved to America in 1917.  On January 15, 1931 Rachmaninoff (soon after he had finished a European concert tour) and a couple other Russian immigrants signed a letter in the *New York Times* criticizing Soviet Russia:  &gt;[...] all Russia is groaning under the terrible yoke of a numerically negligible but well-organized gang of Communists intent on reducing the peasants to a state of abject misery and that these unfortunate sufferers are being daily and systematically subjected to indescribable privations, humiliations and torture. At no time, in no country, has there ever existed a government responsible for so many cruelties, wholesale murders, and common-law crimes in general.  In response to the letter, the performance of his music was banned in the Soviet Union, which was only later lifted after Roosevelt resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.	human
246	Week 15    &amp;nbsp;   On February 2^nd , B.D. - a soldier in the 8^th Infantry – wrote to his father [the following excerpts are either taken from sentences or otherwise from censorship office, attached to the Military Court folder]: “That's a bunch of crooks back in Italy; but they'll pay back once the war is over … I have always told you well to keep you up, but I got to a point I need to spit it out … I have been a liar so far, that it was all make believe … they feed us stuff that even beasts don't want to look at it … I am fed up with this war and there is no beginning for peace … once we are done we'll throw ourselves on the ground … but rest assured I won't dye for this rotten Italy!”   The Italian Army did not have nearly enough men to look through all the exchanged letters – as it would have been the ambition of the High Command – far from it, only a small sample (estimates fell as low as 2%, with special care though on some “notorious” elements) of the letters from and to the front were opened. This one was though, and yielded its author five years of jail and a significant fine of 500 lire.   Worse luck had those whose infractions were committed openly; such as one M.E. - a soldier in the 1^st Artillery – who argued back at his Lieutenant that “the war was the ruination of Italy and of all the man fighting it, because those who spoke [well of the war] did not know what it was” and later added that “those in Caporetto had done well, because they were tired of the war”. The fact that he had written on a booklet words “hateful towards the Monarchy and exalting of anarchism” and that he had sold a pair of shoes and knickers weighted also against him, so that he was sentenced to twenty years in jail.   The same sentence occurred to a soldier F.U. and a Sergeant D.T.G. that the week before had thrown some bread in the Austrian trenches in exchange for a few cigarettes. The men who had witnessed the event failing to open fire on the Austrians were sentenced to seven years instead.   Military Courts had of course to take into account whether there was a history of unruly behavior; such was the case of a D.C.G – soldier in the 4^th Infantry – who had repeatedly expressed his anti-patriotic sentiments to his comrades, once even praising an officer who had been caught prisoner and expressing his thought that the Austrians were “his brothers” and that, if he had been able to go back to his home, he would have written on the walls “Long live Austria!” and “Down with Italy!”.   Besides these episodes his actual good state of service prompted the court to grant him generic extenuating circumstances, resulting in life imprisonment instead of death.   The courts were to some extent obviously overworked, so that informing the families of their proceedings was neither a priority nor necessarily in agreement with the general policy of keeping the military issues within the military. Thus on the 29^th of January a A.C. - widow of one U.C. who had allegedly left his position with others while the remaining portion of their Brigade held the bridgehead of Pinzano to be eventually surrounded and destroyed – wrote to the Command: “To His Excellence, It has been two months since my husband … has been shot, and until now I knew nothing of it; therefore, if the sentence was deserved, because he had betrayed the Motherland, then I'll accept it and all his superiors have done, that don't act without care or for revenge; but if on the other hand it was a mistake or a false report, then I must beg His Excellence to look into the matter and remember that I am a widow with child and in need, in the truest meaning of the word.”   &amp;nbsp;   During WW1 5,200,000 Italians served in the Army. 571,000 of them died, 451,645 were declared invalid, 57,000 died as prisoners of war while some 60,000 were lost somewhere – either dying unaccounted or not returning to their previous domicile.  Through the same years 400,000 cases were sent to court for violations committed while under service terms [this is not including the 470,000 men who did not answer the call to arms – 370,000 being Italian living in foreign countries^1 – who did not serve in the military and therefore did not fall under military jurisdiction, unlike civilians in war zones as we will see]. This gives a total of around 6% for the enlisted men that were subjected to some inquiry by the military justice – 350,000 cases were settled before the amnesty of September 2^nd 1919 (around 210,000 were found guilty and 140,000 not guilty); 50,000 were still open at the time. As historian Alberto Monticone noted, “6% of indicted in an Army is a symptom of a severe internal fracture and leads to believe that either indiscipline and rebellion were widespread or that some sort of divide, of inability to build a mutual understanding had developed between the commands and a portion of the troops”.   &amp;nbsp;   It is generally established that the nature of those violations was not political. That they were not – unlike the vehement claims of the interventionist public opinion makers – the result of a conscious defeatist effort, whether from the Socialists, the Catholics or the neutralist fraction of the establishment. That there was no network of saboteurs spreading among the troops, that any influence of the civil society on the troops' morale was minimal, including the most infamous episodes such as the revolt of the Catanzaro Brigade or the “socialist” conspiracy of Pradamano. That the defeat of Caporetto was not the result of a military strike of any sort.  Such a view is supported essentially by any source that looked at the bulk of the army from outside, trying to find ties between the high politics ground and the life of the trench soldier. And it is fair to say that, in writing a history of the War, looking from above, there is little cause to question the non-political nature of these “crimes”. But, if we consider a history of the people at war, our perspective might shift a bit.   It is true that those actions appear driven by a less than conscious political mind, inspired first and foremost by the material conditions of the men – and often the most “extreme” practices such as self-mutilation were the result of deep, genuine ignorance – and of course, fear. But it's easy to forget what the realization of the war reality had been for many of those men. The realization that some force beyond their understanding had taken them from their home, their family, their life and placed them somewhere else. Where others were in charge of their fate, where being ordered to this or that battalion, to this or that portion of the front, where being found unable or able, ill or healthy, was the difference between life and death. A few miles away people were safe, they were safe in  the hospitals, they were safe along the supply lines, in the rear, the depots, everywhere else but there; there they might as well be all dead. As men muttered to each other, “war was war, and them who didn't run went down”.  And it wasn't an exaggerated perception: casualty rates in the worst positions around the time of a major offensive could reach 90%, while dropping significantly in other areas.   What realistic political action was left then to those men, other than either defy military justice or die? It's a common trap to disqualify as non political, those actions that are not the result of a political organization, of a political mindset; it's even easier to disregard the simplest actions of men as irrelevant, being ultimately a confuse manifestation of the ignorant sentiments of a thoughtless mass. But political actions need not to be competent, effective, to project any lasting impact impact on society, that we could see from outside. The fact that those men's behavior lacks political connotations for us – or for the political observers overall – does not mean that it had no political connotation for them. And we can't really claim to be able to read into the mind of the man who cursed against the King to establish whether he was a socialist, a pacifist, an anarchist, a man who had forgotten himself for a minute, a violent, a coward, a callous criminal or one who had had one too many drinks.  A task – that of mind reading – that was often the trade of military judges, informants and military police; attempting to sort out the defeatist from the incautious, the fool from the socialist, the naive from the subversive. Police reports, sentences and censored letters are the main sources on these men's state of mind – and they are obviously partial and incomplete.    But the military authorities could not do otherwise, as they had to look at the men with a specific goal in mind: to keep them in line, to ensure a minimum of discipline, to suppress but also somehow prevent those violations that constantly nipped away at the nation's very needed manpower.  And to prevent them was the key point; for – no matter how much of the High Command personal inclinations translated into the harsh and often callous treatment of the soldiers – Cadorna had soon accepted that there was no way to simply motivate, to persuade the soldiers to die in scores, for reasons they could not understand. They could be kept together to some extent – and the most effective way appeared to be the perspective that a great victory was the only way of ending the war – but it had to be a defensive fight on the moral front; a fight as decisive as that with the enemy on the battlefront.	human
247	The Army Commander had found himself in charge of a growing organism of impressive scale and size – made up for the vast majority of men that were not only not professionals, but would not have been considered for the Army at all during peace time: intellectuals, socialists, illiterates, violents, men too old, too young had to be formed into units after a brief period of training (during 1917 Officers training could last as little as two weeks). The life of this cumbersome body was ruled by Military Law, that in Italy still meant the Military Code of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont of 1859 (adopted for the unified Kingdom in 1869); that in turn was by and large the same that had been adopted in 1840, when the Army had been conceived as a semi professional organization of a few tens of thousands. As Gen. A Di Giorgio noted in his relation for the Caporetto Inquest Committee, “the military penal code, clearly anachronistic well before the conflict, had been left unaltered with its procedure and included several types of offenses that were no longer possible, while other most serious violations were not even mentioned.”   To handle this mess, Cadorna made large, extensive resort to the Article 251 of the aforementioned Code, that granted the Chief of Staff legislative power over the provinces under military jurisdiction.^2 And that he had begun doing immediately, ordering on July 28^th 1915 that:   *1 – Anyone, either military or civilian within the territories of the Kingdom declared in state of war or within the territories occupied by the King's Army, who sends mail towards any destination, containing news of any sort concerning the strength, numbers, preparations, defenses […] dislocation or movements of the troops, discipline, health, regardless of whether the mail had reached its destination, for the mere shipping of it, is subject to sanctions as per […]*    *2 – Anyone […] who sends mail containing expressions even generic, denigrating the war operations, disparaging or contemptuous towards the army, the administration or military corps, or offensive towards members of the army, even unspecified, is subject to sanctions as per […]*   *3 – Anyone […] who gives on the state defense or the military operations news different from those given to the public by the government or the army commands, or equally gives on public order, national economy or any other facts of public concern, news that could in any was disrupt the public tranquility or damage anyhow public interests, is subject to sanctions as per […]*   *4 – Cognizance of such offenses belongs, for every instance, to War Tribunals.*   The vast generality of the possible violations and their subordination to Military Courts meant that as a matter of fact, since the beginning of the war, the military authority was embodied with a theoretically absolute power over the enlisted men (and the civilians in war zones – 60,000 cases, mostly for common crimes though). A situation that did not diminish but rather increased with the course of the war, as more provinces relevant for war industrial and agricultural products were included in the “war zone”^3 and the legislative output of the High Command continued, overlapping with that of the Government that developed similar provisions, culminating with that decree, named after Justice Ministry Ettore Sacchi (October 4^th 1917) – that we may discuss in further detail in the immediate future – and essentially mirrored the generic nature of the military decrees, punishing “any act or statement that may depress the public opinion”. In this atmosphere, the Military courts had often to operate under pressure of the authority that, while demanding severity^4 was also prone to defer to Court a large number of merely circumstantial or trivial cases (in 1918 the maximum allowed delay in returning to one's regiment after license was brought down to 24 hours; after that one was reported as deserter) – which explains the roughly 1/3 proceedings resulting in absolution. Both the troops exhaustion and the increased pressure of the High Command towards a severe application of the existing legislation worked to increase the number of trial cases through the years.   &amp;nbsp;   Here is a breakdown of the most common charges.      -   | desertion | indiscipline | self mutilation | surrender ------|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------ indicted |189,425 | 31,000 | 15,000 | 8,500 found guilty | 101,665 | 24,500 | 10,000 | 5,300 acquitted | 60,898 | - | - | - exempted | 26,862^a | - | - | -   a – Exempt per *Decreto Luogotenenziale* of Dec. 10^th 1917 that allowed safe return to the ranks to those who had gone missing after Caporetto, as long as they showed up before New Year's Eve.   &amp;nbsp;   The following numbers are those of the men found guilty, per year (July to June).   year | desertion | indiscipline | self mutilation | surrender ------|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------ 15 – 16 |10,272 | 4,600 | 1,094 | 1,800 16 – 17 | 27,817 | 6,900 | 3,118 | 2,300 17 – 18 | 55,034 | 10,000 | 2,136^b| 1,100 until Nov. 18 | 8,562 | 3,000 | 272 | 100   b – It is evident that the amount of general violations in the Army rose with war fatigue – being often the result of failed promises of “one last offensive” or “soon to be provided, better treatment, food, accommodation”. The drop in self mutilation followed the deliberation (19^th of October 1916) to keep those who were found guilty under military supervision [since September 1917, those suspect of self harm were kept apart from regular wounded, in “self mutilators” hospitals], which also meant that their sentence was to be served on the front line, as soon as their injuries allowed it. So that only those who had inflicted themselves permanently disabling injuries would avoid service.   &amp;nbsp;   Finally a breakdown of the sentences terms [sentences up to seven years were suspended to allow return to the front; above seven years military law required five years scale graduation, i.e. 10-15-20 and so on].      -   | sentence  ------|------------- up to seven years |130,000  ten to life | 21,000  life | 15,000 death | 4,000^c   c – Most of the death sentences were not carried off , because they hit those who had deliberately left the ranks and surrendered.    &amp;nbsp;   If plenty was done in terms of repression, very little was done on the other hand in order to promote and encourage the soldier's participation to the war effort. Partly, as we saw already, because Cadorna held no delusions – he wasn't entirely wrong; improved morale after his replacement with A. Diaz seems to have resulted essentially from better food, better defensive positions, very limited offensive actions, casualty rates dropping to 20% of those of the first years – that the men could be turned into anything resembling the professional soldier he had learned to conceive as the Army's backbone. And partly because for Cadorna, as well as for a large portion of the Military, propaganda was a political matter – propaganda within the army meant politics within the army; and nothing was more dangerous than allowing the divisive influence of politics within the ranks. Thus the staunch opposition against war propaganda, the mistrust faced by the interventionist politicians who had volunteered – who were often turned away from commanding duties or kept under police surveillance during their service – the refusal to admit parliament members to the area of operations (the general contempt of the military men towards the politicians was in fact reciprocated in full, the usual joke being that military career was “what was left for the stupid child”) .  In the last months of 1917 though, things had begun to change: by then, even Cadorna himself had to agree that in order to keep a decent morale new paths had to be attempted. His downfall after Caporetto prevented him for taking any concrete steps in this direction.  Initiatives resumed immediately after his replacement with A. Diaz, a decisive role being played by the work of a philosopher and pedagogist – Giuseppe Lombardo-Radice – then volunteer in the V Army Corp. He had repeatedly suggested and more or less undertaken independently of the Command's authorization initiatives to spread national ideals among the troops; by January 1918 the Army leadership was willing to listen.  In fact, after Caporetto, a persistent penetration of Austrian defeatist propaganda into the Italian Army and the border populations had been reported; the French and British too, now more directly involved with the Italian front, had expressed their concern over the inadequate, or lacking entirely, propaganda system.   In view of this, Lombardo-Radice was allowed to experiment with his creation: what he had called “pointers for a discussion among the troops” – a short essay-like prompt aimed at providing officers with the right words to address the troops and providing opportunity for “talks” on patriotic themes. The initiative was successful and soon followed with the establishment of a propaganda office, nicknamed “service P.” within the V Army. Extended in the following months to the entire Italian Army and complemented with the creation of various “Army press outlets” discussing both the inside news of the Army Corps and the overall situation. Also selected press from the Country begun to be regularly distributed to the men – at times even pieces that had been censored inside were allowed circulation on the front.   	human
248	*We are making war for the soldier: the farmer, the worker, the clerk. It is fought for all them who struggle and suffer in the fields and the cities, both in Italy and outside of it. We make war for the proletarians: this is a proletarian war. Only a few dangerous fools can speak of imperialism. [...] Italy […] is a modest nation, of modest people, barely putting together their nest, saving up for their  tidy place […] smothered in that congregation of industrial powers […] in that colossal trust of producers, that wanted through the war to impose without question to the world its methods, working hours. […] We weren't big enough to wait this to pass, nor small enough that it wouldn't affect us. […] Our problem was that of an upcoming business, hit with the shock of a formidable competition: either to work through losses, as long as required, or give up and sell. Here again it was a serious matter: of most serious concern for the humble rather than the rich. It was a matter of the people, not the wealthy. […]*  *The economy of the Nation is the economy of the masses, of those who aren't rich. To ensure the position of the State among other States – the very program of the war – to grant even means of sustenance to its process of development, means to ensure and safeguard the future of the people, not that of the wealthy […] It means doing down to the last the interests of the soldier: the farmer, the worker, the clerk. Those who are wealthy can get by regardless of anyone else's wealth. It's those who aren't wealthy that can't. The rich's wealth is their own; the poor's is that of the State they are part of. […] We fight to lift our people out of their struggle of eternal work for hire. We want the Italian people to be worth tomorrow just as much as any other European, and to live not worse than a German, than and English, than a French, than a Belgian. Here's our grand economical liberation – that concerns all of our lands, not only those held by the Austrians - […] We won't be any longer the miserable, the working beasts, those who work harder for the lowest pay. […] We won't be forced any more to drag our bags, our children, our tears, through every third class coach of this large globe.*   &amp;nbsp;    Thus state propaganda made its belated entrance into the Italian public sphere, where it would soon enough play a significant role again. But perhaps more relevantly it did so in conjunction with the extension to a large portion of the Italian society of a special jurisdiction that – without being recognized as exceptional – operated on parallel ground with those civil right guarantees (such as liberty of the press and to some extent opinion and expression) that had been tentatively included within the Statute and whose strength relied very much on the praxis followed by the public administration and the justice system. Challenging those provisions, the new legislation [that on practical terms was both exceptional and exception to the Statute – for example no new forms of violation could in principle be created through executive legislation] exposed those principles to an erosion of authority. That a similar turn took place on the ground of civil legislation with the “Sacchi Decree” is something that we'll be able to discuss further ahead.   &amp;nbsp;   1 – The Italian inability to reach those masses was both a result of inadequate propaganda effort and the material limitations of the assistance provisions offered by the Government. No state driven campaign was developed to persuade the men to return to offer their lives to the Motherland – with interventionists often denouncing how the organizations of Italians abroad were not stigmatizing enough those who declined the chance to serve in the army. Yet in terms of positive steps almost nothing was done: it is telling how in 1917 the US Army managed to be more successful in recruiting among Italians than the Italian Army had been – a fact in which a major part was played by the hefty insurance prize offered by the United States (roughly equal 50,000 lire – enough to buy a decent piece of land – and paid in full, unlike the Italian war pension that for a rank soldier was somewhere in between 300 and 1,000 lire per year). But the Italian Army up until late 1917 failed to provide basic accommodation to those few who had come back and had no longer a family who could host them: it was not uncommon for those men to spend their license hiding in the rear, being too ashamed to reveal that they had nowhere else to go.   2 – A careful observer might note that the Code predated the Italian Statute of 1848: it did not therefore address the issue of the competing legislative powers of the High Command and the Government – as per the Code there might have been a reasonable expectation that the Chief of Staff and Head of Government would be the same person, which is to say the King; who actually at the time of WW1 was neither. The article 251 that provided the Chief of Staff with legislative powers had in fact been added in 1859 but the situation had not been clarified in the context of the new non military Zanardelli Code of 1889 or the Procedural Code of 1913, that established protection of certain individual rights.  Things were in fact a bit more complex: The King was Head of the Army. The kings had conceded a few points to the parliamentary practice since the promulgation of the Statute in 1848; but control of the Army was not one of them. He routinely addressed generals privately, ignoring the parliamentary routs; still, in peacetime, it was clear that the Army was somewhat dependent from the Ministry of War – it was after all the Parliament that approved the Army's budget. During war though... Italy had never been in such a long war to require definition of the issue. The King could not be responsible towards the Parliament, the Head of the Army should on the other hand be accountable towards the Parliament through the Ministry of War, the King was by law the Head of the Army. And one of these did not fit. For the Parliament, to force the issue would mean move against the King's privilege and the Army's perceived autonomy; for the King, to force the issue, would mean to move against the Parliament, likely provoking a Ministerial fall. To avoid this chance – especially dangerous in time of war – the King made a gesture to give up the Control of the Army to the Chief of Staff who was responsible, yet formally invested of the King's powers. Among those, that of passing executive orders in the war zone, that had value of law decrees. The King could of course challenge them – which would have meant a likely resignation of the Head of Staff – and the Prime Minister could as well bring the issue to the King, offering his resignation as well (which actually happened on late February 1916 over Cadorna's request to Salandra for the sacking of the Ministry of War – the King solved the issue by pretending not to hear).   3 – On May 22^nd 1915 Provinces along the front had been put under military jurisdiction. A first expansion occurred on July 15^th. Further increases occurred during 1917, resulting in the inclusion of almost the entire northern regions by December 1917. I have made a [“map”](https://imgur.com/a/sZWzn) to give an idea of the extent of the war zone.   4 – Cadorna's reasoning is not devoid of logic and in its impressive backwardness betrays a concept of military justice as merely instrumental, a tool to secure the Army's functioning rather than the men's well being or individual rights. As he observed in his letter to then Prime Minister Antonio Salandra (January 14^th 1916): *It is unfortunately deeply rooted in the minds of the soldiers and within the country, the idea that, ended the war, the Government will proceed to grant large indulgences, so that sentences to life imprisonment or military jail no longer intimidate the badly inclined; who, on the other hand, would rather be sentenced than face the dangers of the war [...] During the time of war therefore, only death sentences can have compelling power [...] but in many processes the evidence can be at most circumstantial, and therefore military courts can not – as it would be otherwise healthy – pronounce exemplary death sentences. It is therefore fiercely deplorable that our new penal code does no longer allow, in cases of grave collective crimes, the faculty of decimation of the guilty units, that was by far – during wartime – the most effective measure to keep the unruly in line and safeguard discipline.*   The fact that it was difficult to collect evidence, worked as an argument in favor of summary executions. The extraneousness of such an idea to the whole of public right was not lost to contemporaries either; As lt. General Attorney Donato Antonio Tommasi observed after the war: *it is not possible to understand how from the law, the repression of a collective crime would be done under the form of decimation, only because one is not able to ascertain the individual penal responsibilities*   &amp;nbsp;   E.

On January 15, 1931 Rachmaninoff (soon after he had finished a European concert tour) and a couple other Russian immigrants signed a letter in the *New York Times* criticizing Soviet Russia:  &gt;[...] all Russia is groaning under the terrible yoke of a numerically negligible but well-organized gang of Communists intent on reducing the peasants to a state of abject misery and that these unfortunate sufferers are being daily and systematically subjected to indescribable privations, humiliations and torture. At no time, in no country, has there ever existed a government responsible for so many cruelties, wholesale murders, and common-law crimes in general.  He was censured in a number of Russian newspapers (e.g. *Vechernaya Moskva* &amp; Pravda* In response to the letter, the performance of his music was banned in the Soviet Union, which was only later lifted in 1933 after Roosevelt resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.	human
250	A total of seven British and American battleships participated in the fighting in Normandy. Of these, five directly participated in the bombardment on June 6th, while the other two remained in reserve, but would join the bombardment force later in June. Three of the ships were American, while four, including the two that joined later, were British. The French *Courbet* and British *Centurion* were also involved with the landings, but only as immobile breakwaters, though *Courbet* retained her AA armament to help provide air defence.  The four British battleships were *Ramillies*, *Warspite*, and the sister ships *Nelson* and *Rodney*. *Ramillies* and *Warspite* were armed with 15in guns, while the other two used 16in guns. *Warspite* and *Ramillies* formed, along with the monitor *Roberts* (armed with two 15in guns), the core of Bombardment Force D. This was responsible for fire support for the eastern beaches, Juno, Gold and Sword. For the most part, the battleships fired on German coastal batteries east of the River Orne. The British ships opened fire at 5 AM on the 6th. *Warspite* was targeting the German Villerville battery, in the village of Les Bruyeres, while *Ramillies* fired upon the battery at Benerville. *Roberts* fired upon the battery at Houlgate. At 5:15, the bombardment force was attacked by three German torpedo boats (small destroyers), which had sortied from Le Havre following the first reports of ships offshore. As the boats broke through the smoke screen placed off Le Havre by the RAF, they encountered the bombardment force, fired eighteen torpedoes, and fled. The torpedoes narrowly missed both battleships, but one struck and sank the Norwegian destroyer *Svenner*. As the day progressed, the bombardment ships fired on other batteries, and in turn came under fire from those same batteries. *Warspite* suffered the heaviest fire, and was straddled several times, causing her to have to move position. Over the course of the day, they fired several hundred 15in rounds. In the evening, *Ramillies* withdrew to rearm at Portsmouth, while *Warspite* moved away from the beaches at 23:05, and anchored offshore. *Rodney* sailed for Normandy on the morning on the 6th. However, following her arrival at 2:30 AM, she was ordered to return to Spithead to remain in reserve. She would join the bombardment force on the 7th. On the 7th, *Warspite* would again fire on gun batteries east of the Orne. She also fired upon a number of targets of opportunity, directed by observers ashore and in the air. Between 16:50 and 17:15, she supported 45 Commando, Royal Marines, in their attack on Franceville. By the end of the 7th, she had fired a total of 334 15in shells. *Rodney*, meanwhile, supported troops offshore, firing 132 16in rounds in support of 3rd Canadian Division. *Nelson* remained in reserve until the 11th, when she fired her first bombardment against German troops around Caen.  The three American battleships were *Arkansas*, *Texas* and *Nevada*. All three were armed with 14in guns. *Arkansas* and *Texas* formed Bombardment Force C, off Omaha, while *Nevada* was part of Bombardment Force A off Utah. The *Texas* fired a preparatory bombardment on the battery at Pointe Du Hoc before the Rangers landed. She then moved to fire upon the batteries and troop concentrations behind Omaha Beach itself. *Arkansas*, meanwhile, was solely used for firing on targets behind and around Omaha Beach. *Nevada*, off Utah, began by shelling the German battery at Azeville. She then began to engage emplacements near St. Vaast-la-Hogue. Following this, she fired in support of the 101st Airborne Division. All three American battleships remained in position until the 8th-9th, when they withdrew to rearm.  The bombardments successfully prevented the shore batteries firing upon the landing ships offshore. However, they were relatively ineffective at knocking out the batteries. Batteries were suppressed, but not destroyed, and so could continue to fire after the bombardment stopped; the only reason they did not engage the landing ships was that the batteries preferred to fire on the battleships. There were two factors that made these bombardments ineffective. The first was the inaccuracy of naval guns, especially at the long ranges that naval bombardments demanded. Fired from a rolling ship, designed for fire at closer ranges, and not designed for pin-point accuracy and sustained rapid fire, they frequently missed their targets. According to one spotter, shells often missed by a mile or more, while official estimates of accuracy were at about 1%. The second was that naval shells were not effectively designed for firing on land targets. Naval guns tended to fire on a low trajectory, perfect for naval combat; however, for firing at land targets, a higher trajectory which could drop shells behind hills and the like was better. Naval guns used high velocities, which required shells with thick bodies and comparatively small bursting charges, making them less effective than land-based artillery or bombers. A 16in HE shell (weighing 2048lbs) will damage 1400 square feet of a steel-framed building, while a 2000lb bomb will damage 8800 square feet.   	human
251	Seven battleships took part; four British and three U.S.  * The Wyoming-class battleship USS *Arkansas*  * The Nevada-class battleship USS *Nevada*  * The Nelson-class battleship HMS *Nelson* (British)  * The Revenge-class battleship HMS *Ramilies* (British)  * The Nelson-class battleship HMS *Rodney* (British)  * The Queen Elizabeth-class battleship HMS *Warspite* (British)  The battleship USS *Texas* fired 255 14-inch shells at the suspected 155 mm gun positions on Pointe du Hoc, [leaving some nice big craters](http://en.normandie-tourisme.fr/site/tsimg/840x630/PCUNOR014FS0008S_1.jpg); the guns had in fact been moved away from the beach, and were later destroyed by U.S. Army Rangers in their famous mission. The *Texas* then closed to within 3,000 yards of the shore, firing directly at German machine gun and artillery positions, along with several destroyers doing the same. The presence of the *Texas* was a major force around the Dog One exit, helping to clear it. The USS *Arkansas* also bombarded Omaha Beach, and then moved to around Cherbourg in mid-June to support ground troops against shore positions in the seizure of the port there, as well as duel with shore batteries. The USS *Nevada* supported the landings on Utah Beach, and then proceeded to join *Arkansas* at Cherbourg.	human
252	"Basically, they sang different songs. And did lots of and lots of recitations.   The approach to basic literacy education before the Civil War is known as the Alphabet Method. It was a mostly oral approach where children were taught how to spell before they were allowed to read. Nora Webster published his popular speller in 1783, which included lists of words (culminating in eight-syllable words) that children were expected to learn before they could get to the reading part of reading. In effect, children were taught the parts before they were shown the whole.   They would use hornbooks and primers, usually focused on religious phrases and texts, to learn increasingly complex syllabary. The learning focused on ""reading"" words by each letter or syllable. For example a list of one syllable words might include ""God"", ""grace"", ""peace"", and ""bad"" (""bad"" would be read by children as ""bee ay dee."")  But regarding songs, they were a common tool long before the familiar one you mention as children would sing the letters to the tune of a song they already knew. A popular one was the hymn ""Refreshed by Gentle Slumbers"" (which sounds similar to ""My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean""). There was also a rhyme/song called ""Apple Pie ABC"" or even more delightfully known as ""The Tragical Death of A, Apple Pye Who was Cut in Pieces and Eat by Twenty-Five Gentlemen with whom All Little People Ought to be Very well acquainted."" Benjamin Harris' primer, published around 1690, contained phrases like ""In Adam's fall, we sin all"", ""Thy life to mend, this Book attend."" There was no shortage of inventive ways to get small minds to learn the nonsensical mess that is the English language.     "	human

256	"True. Technically the current British Royal Family's ""house"" or surname is Mountbatten-Windsor. Windsor is of course the royal United Kingdom monarchical heritage side of the family. The surname / House was changed to Windsor during World War I, because the prior house name was considered to German - and German sentiment was at an all time low in Britain. However, the Mountbatten side of the royal family actually caused quite a stir in British nobility and politics. Basically when Queen (at the time Princess) Elizabeth II married the dashing naval commander Philip Mountbatten (of House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg a German and Danish royal family) British law at the time stated that when a royal woman married a nobleman, she was to take his surname. However, Elizabeth's parents, particularly her mother, was thoroughly against the future Queen taking the surname Mountbatten. Prince Philip for his part, being a traditional sort of man wanted his wife, and their children to take his surname. His uncle, the famous war hero Lord Mountbatten, was vehemently pushing for the royal family to take the name Mountbatten. When Queen Elizabeth's father died, a few years after her marriage to Philip, she was now the Queen of the UK. She decreed that her children would take the name ""Windsor"", and only ""Windsor"" - to the delight of her mother and other Windsor House royals. The Mountbattens found a legal loophole, that allowed for them to basically take the matter to court. They won. The two houses, at least when it comes to Queen Elizabeth II's decedents, Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince Henry etc... were merged in the early 1960s in to ""Mountbatten-Windsor"". That is the technical name / house for the royal family. But the kingly / queenly bloodline comes from the Windsor side. Either way, both the Windsors and Mountbatten's are actually not overly British in heritage, but mostly German - which is sort of ironic. "	human

262	Yep. Crown Prince Peter II was kind of thrust in to a tight spot when he was 17 years old. Give in to German demands, or hold true to his true feelings of being pro-British / Allies. Germany invaded Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941, and Prince Peter II fled to Greece, then Palestine, and from there went to London, England. A lot of deposed monarchs of formerly allied countries fled to London. From there Prince Peter petitioned the British Government to supply more help and aid to Yugoslavia. The British did just that... but gave most of their aid to the Tito's Communist Partisans, and not the Serbian Monarchical / Nationalist Chetnik factions, that were fighting the Partisans and the Axis. The British Special Operations Executive (Special Forces for clandestine activity behind enemy lines) was heavily infiltrated by Communists, and also faced pressure from the Soviet Union to back Tito's Communist Partisan Army - instead of the Chetniks. So although Crown Prince Peter II and his royal court were in exile in the UK, the UK basically sealed Yugoslavia / Serbia's fate - and that was a post-war Communist country. Peter petitioned the British throughout the war to send more supplies and armaments to Draža Mihailović's loyal Chetniks, but instead that organization was labelled as collaborators, and thus received very little to no aid from the British SOE. Eventually most of the Chetnik's and other loyal Yugoslav Monarchists were rounded up by Tito's Communists, and after the war were sentenced in trials and put to death. Crown Prince Peter was to be king of a country that he no longer ruled. He eventually left the United Kingdom, which he felt had betrayed him and his people, and migrated to the United States. Living the rest of his life modestly and faded in to obscurity.   This happened to a lot of monarch and countries after World War II - with Poland being the the biggest and most egregious example of being screwed over by their supposed ally, in order to placate the Soviet Union.  	human

For example, the AskHistorians community asks and answers a lot of questions about WW2 and Medieval Europe, presumably because the members of the AskHistorians community are largely American and European. Would an AskHistorians-like group in another region of the world focus on similar questions? I presume not. Which historical events and time periods consistently capture the popular imagination in, say, China or India or Nigeria or Russia? Would those historical narratives be compatible with the answers we read here, or do the major narratives in different regions offer competing, incompatible stories of world history?	human

It's interesting, though, that this trope seems to start with a general globalization which has a partially Japanese face (""Apparently it was originally meant to be Leyland-Toyota, representing the merger of Britain's then-nationalized motor industry [British Leyland] with a Japanese giant."" in *Alien* or *Aliens*; the city-speak of *Blade Runner* was not simply Japanese but a real mix) before articulating more forcefully as specifically Japan-focused anxiety towards the middle of the decade.

269	Relations between the US and Great Britain were significantly strained until well into the 19th century, mainly after effects of the War of 1812 subsided.  Following the [British defeat of Yorktown in October 1781](http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/yorktown-campaign/), it became apparent that British forces were unlikely to defeat the Americans and their allies. Negotiations for ending the war started a few months after, with [John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay](http://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/treaty-of-paris) representing American interests.  David Hartley and Richard Oswald represented the British government.  From the start, one of the biggest points of contention was that the Americans, especially John Jay, insisted that Great Britain publicly recognize the United States as an independent country.  British representatives were disinclined to give in to, in their opinion, an inflammatory request.  From the British perspective, they were ceding all control of the 13 colonies to these rebels, it was adding insult to injury if they would have to recognize them as a nation.    The Treaty of of Paris, signed in September 1783, is believed to have been extremely generous to the Americans, since they gained not only  public recognition of statehood, but also larger land boundaries and other beneficial parts of the treaty. Some historians have credited this by saying that [Great Britain wanted to maintain close economic ties to the Americans, both in terms of trading, but also for the ability for creditors to legally call up their debts](http://www.jstor.org.proxy-bc.researchport.umd.edu/stable/40105313).  Britain saw the Americans as having appealing financial markets for purchasing and selling goods, and foresaw the future economic uncertainty of America as one that would potentially bolster Great Britain.   Britain did not fully abide by all parts of the treaty.  They did not abandon several of their forts along the American Western frontier near the great leaks and even built a new one in 1794.  It took an additional treaty, [Jay's Treaty of 1795](https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/jay.html) for that to take place.  This treaty was beneficial to all sides.  It brought about a decade of drama-free trade between the two nations, but it was extremely divisive at the time.  The Treaty, authored primarily by Alexander Hamilton, actually caused a huge fractioning in American politics, with pro-Treaty Federalists on one side, and the anti-Treaty Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson on the other.  Regardless of the internal strife, this period was the most advantageous for both countries since the end of the American Revolution, with the states being able to now even trade with other British colonies.   The treaty expired in 1806, under President Jefferson who rejected a new version of that treaty known as the [Monroe-Pinkney Treaty](http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/monroe-pinkney-treaty).  Jefferson had commanded the American diplomats to get a deal with Great Britain that solidified their practice of 'neutral shipping' since America was trading both with Great Britain and her enemy, France (during the Napoleonic Wars).  Great Britain countered the offer with a new deal that, in their view, greatly favored American business interests.  Jefferson, outraged by this, rejected this treaty and began a series of policies that resulted in economic warfare between the two nations, ultimately culminating with the War of 1812.	human

276	Yes, of course, there was a lot going on behind the scenes with the replacement of the Karadjordjevic Monarchy in Yugoslavia.  Nothing ever happens in a silo and this is no exception to that.  Tito certainly made much of the currency of mythology that Yugoslavia's liberation was wholly domestic.  In fact, during Tito's spat with Stalin Yugoslavia's liberation from Nazi Germany being a domestic liberation rather than liberation by the Red Army was brought up in Tito's responses to Stalin about Yugoslavia's treachery vis-a-vie the Cominform.  Of course, the Partizan army wouldn't have been as well supplied if not for British weapons and so on.  I was just looking to give a quick example in response to OP's question.

278	Well, I'll chip my latin-american experience as a history enthusiast - and back-to-school-at-my-thirties student.   In Latin America in general, and in particular in Argentina, a lot of the usual questions capture a lot of attention - Medieval history is fascinating on its own, and quite glamorized in film, games, etc. WW2 is always a big draw for people into military history. But a lot of things are a bit different.   There is a big market here for 19th century historical novels: histories of our native american *malones* taking captives who then grow into part of the tribes - think Dance with Wolves but with *gauchos* -, and a lot of revisiting our Independence Wars, especially the more 'human' sides of our *próceres*. Ask me about Güemes, the aristocrat-turned-*gaucho* that consistently had affairs with high-society ladies, and was apparently killed by being shot in the ass!  History, as a discipline, is quite left-wing (or broadly progressive, so to speak) in Argentina, and there is a lot of work on recent history - the Juntas, the extent of U.S/USSR involvement in Latin American affairs, our first unions - which were mainly anarchist. The Peronista government is also quite interesting for us - a lot of the debates in Argentina are about how to characterize it. And you get a lot of different views, from 'fascist-with-election dictatorship' to 'national liberation movement' or 'esoteric keystone to Latin America liberation' and I'm not even kidding with the last one.   Latin America is also quite particular in the sheer amount of inmigration shaping its population - Argentina with a distinct italian and spanish flavour - and a lot of questions I get are about ancestry, and about how our great-grandparents managed to come here with the rags on their backs and prosper.   So, I guess that the same images that capture everybody's imagination from mass media are common to the world, but each country, each region - hell, each town - have their particular fetishes and areas where pop history just doesn't offer enough depth and want to know more.   I'd love to hear from someone from Asia, or Africa, or pretty much anywhere, obviously.   Hope this adds something to your view, and sorry for the clunky english!	human

280	"The way I understand it is that August II of House Wettin was the Elector of Saxony within the Holy Roman Empire when he was also elected King of Poland. Poland was not a part of the HRE but could elect kings from from outside of Poland. Thus Augustus held two separate titles from separate ""countries"" since titles could be independent of country. Somewhat similar to how the Austro-Hungarian Emperors were both Emperors of Austria and Kings of Hungary, with Hungary even eventually having a separate legislative body from Austria after 1867  Prussia on the other hand was completely within the HRE originally as the separate Duchy of Prussia and the Electorate of Brandenburg, both ruled by branches of the Hohenzollern family. Eventually these branches combined making the Duchy and Electorate ruled by a single Hohenzollern. This made the Hohenzollern lands large enough and powerful enough within the HRE that Fredrick I named himself King in Prussia. However titles within the HRE could only be granted by the Emperor. While Frederick had a good amount of power he was not powerful enough to challenge the Emperor over granting him the official title of ""King of Prussia"". Thus the Hohenzollerns stay as Kings in Prussia until they become powerful enough to be essentially independent of the HRE under Frederick the Great.

287	"The tl;dr of this is basically that while there is some truth to these allegations, they are by no means uniform across Tibetan society. I've answered in past r/AskH threads about how there really wasn't anything like the an ""average Tibetan"" in the way we might form a statistical mean of an ""average American."" Tibet is such a diverse place - quite literally, ranging from tropical lowlands of the east and southeast Burmese highlands, to the western deserts, and south-central urban centers - that it's absurd to paint with a broad brush.   Most of these issues discussed reference the Lhasa and it's provincial area called ""U-Tsang"" (Tib. dbus gtsang). Both views, the dystopic Chinese concept of a Tibet of horrors and the over-the-top rainbow-flowing Buddhistic paradaisical image are both huge oversimplifications of life in Lhasa. The vast majority of histories and books that exist in the English language (and Western languages in general, speaking from the German perspective) are centered around Lhasa and from Lhasap perspectives. The Dalai Lama himself was born in the far northeast corner of Amdo, but grew up and spent the majority of his time in Tibet in (you guessed it) Lhasa. Heinrich Harrer's famous *Seven Years in Tibet* spends the first third of the novel walking eastward from the Indian Himalayas, hugging the Nepali border, until spending the majority of the book, and the majority of his time among Tibetans in (yep) Lhasa.   Lhasa is, of course, where the Ganden Phodrang (the Dalai Lama's government) was situated in Tibet. The Ganden Phodrang assumed power in 1642 and was the primary government of Lhasa until the Chinese takeover in 1959. One of the great weaknesses of the Ganden Phodrang was it's over reliance on the Dalai Lama as the head of state and government. Unlike traditional monarchies which try to get an adult heir in office at best, and a legitimate heir at worst, the Dalai Lama institution had a built in weakness with long periods of regency when the Dalai Lama died and his reincarnate was searched for. These reincarnates, called tulkus, (Tib. sprul sku) develop through tradition. So the Dalai Lama tradition, which began around 1540 (and was retroactively applied as far as 1391) eventually developed with the Dalai Lamas out of Lhasa and the Panchen Lamas out of Shigatse taking on the responsibility of recognizing the other's rebirth and serving as their primary teacher. With this shifting power dynamic, it was always a little bit unclear exactly who was in charge, though as long as there was a strong Dalai Lama, he always seemed to be the one to assume power. This changed in the late 1700s when the Panchen Lama made overtures to the Qianlong Emperor, and it seemed like the Panchen Lama had gained the upper hand. Just as well since there was a string of bad luck, (or as is admitted by the Dalai Lama, K. Dhondup, and Glenn H. Mullin, poor understanding of medicine or possibly poisoning) with the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth Dalai Lamas dying extremely young. It wasn't until the 13th Dalai Lama at the turn of the century that one finally retained control.   Of course, while all of this death is going on at the very center of Tibetan political life, the Manchu government was in charge in China and was invited to Tibet to repel the Gurkha invasion which threatened to overwhelm Tibet and plunder Lhasa of all it was worth. The Manchus were welcomed in and tried to reignite the classic northern nomad-Tibetan lama relationship that the Mongols once had with the Tibetans. However, the Manchu were often heavy-handed with their rule (suffering a lot of rebellion and foreign incursion into their territory in the east) and the two Ambans (representatives) were given enormous, sweeping powers to basically commandere Tibetans for their own work projects, to take food, property, and military conscription at will, and were given political power equal to or (arguably) greater than the Dalai Lamas. There were more than a few mass-executions of Tibetans until the Revolution in 1911. Skipping over a lot of details, this overuse of capital punishment by the Manchu led to the new and brief Tibetan state to outlaw the death penalty completely. More on that in a second.   The new Tibetan State, led by the 13th Dalai Lama, wanted to modernize. Tibet prior to this was still mostly tribal. Most of the stuff discussed above, remember, was basically only important in Lhasa and the surrounding provinces. But Tibet is HUGE and contained political units that were only tangentially under the control of the Ganden Phodrang. In general, it's unfair to blanketly label a whole country for the worst of its crimes when it only had marginal control of that area, was limited to certain actors, and is basically ignoring all other mitigating factors. But this isn't limited to the study of Tibet.  "	human
288	"Contd.   Itemized criticisms:   &gt; What this does not talk about is that the Tibetian government, pre-Chinese-invasion, was massively corrupt.  I would say that this is literally true. (Though I sense that whoever wrote this means ""corrupt"" in the sense of ""evil"" like they wrote later on, rather than ""corrupt"" as in ""political corruption,"" which is more true than not.) Tibet was not a modern state, and their effort at modernizing under the 13th Dalai Lama was cut short with his death in 1933. With his death, the modernizers in the Tibetan government were pushed out in favor of traditionalists who set about closing the English and technical schools, blinded and tortured the leader of the modernizers, and most importantly let the army starve.   Why does all of this relate to political corruption? Well to modernize the state, the funds had to come from somewhere. And under the direction of the Manchu government, the Ganden Phodrang was restructured to shift its taxes towards the monasteries. As the monasteries grew in size, power, and membership, they were reluctant to give any of that up. The 13th Dalai Lama, understanding the need for these modern things if it was going to stand any chance of survival in the world, restructured Tibet's finances, diverting funds from the monasteries to these modernizing efforts, most notably a standing army. The army even saw some success on the Amdo front in a brief war with China in the 1920s, but after his death, the army was starved of funding and left to deteriorate. The monasteries had taken their funding back.   &gt; The priests, led by the Dalai Lama who so many westerners find charming, ran the country and led lives of luxury.  As pointed out above, this is largely true that the ""priests"" (though this is a gross oversimplification of the Tibetan religious infrastructure and reeks of Communist propaganda) lived lives of luxury compared to the ""peasant"" class. (Though, it can probably be said that this is true anywhere in the world.) I could stop and point out all of the exceptions to the rule, but that wouldn't be helpful.   I would rather point out that the 13th Dalai Lama, again noted above, made strong efforts to modernize the nation and actually was in conflict with the monasteries. There was a brief rebellion when one of the Sanghas in Lhasa revolted against the Dalai Lama, marching to the Norbulingka Palace (the Dalai Lama's summer home) and defacating in his garden. The new modern army surrounded Sera Monastery and put it to siege. (The monastery held out, waiting to see if Drepung would join them in the rebellion, Ganden had already declared for the Dalai Lama. When Drepung joined the DL, Sera surrendered).   One thing I *do* really hate that is constantly left out of this discussion is that the current Dalai Lama was *16 years old* when the People's Liberation Army came to Lhasa. I usually like to think about who I was at 16, and then imagine myself as the head of a country that was just invaded. He assumed power earlier than the scheduled time (at age 18) and at the time of his flight to India in 1959, he had achieved his (equivalence to a) Ph.D in Buddhist Philosophy. So he spent the last part of his teens as the head of a country that was under military occupation, and the first part of his twenties (also as the head of that country) doing an entire Ph.D. And then immediately went into life as a refugee.   While the presence of slaves/serfs in Tibet is a fascinating and important topic for the discussion of Pre-Modern Tibetan society, to say the Dalai Lama had anything to do with it is a red herring. He had plenty of other stuff to worry about.   &gt; Peasants were slaves, concubines — those who rebelled were tortured or “vanished”.  Other than the slavery issue which I answer in depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/273mh9/there_has_been_some_claim_that_the_dalai_lama/chxbgrd/), I'm not entirely sure what they're saying here about ""vanishings"" or where they're getting their information. ""Concubinage"" in the purely Western sense existed, but it certainly wasn't limited to Tibet, wasn't frowned upon, and oh, right, Tibetan societies are one of the few that normally practiced both polyandry and polygamy.   &gt; The standard of living of the average Tibetian, like it or not, has increased dramatically because the Chinese have taken over  This is largely true. But has less to do with what flag flies over Tibet and more to do with the process of modernization and development. That said, the road wasn't always pleasant and given recent political events, that rocky road of development has caused a lot of antagonism that will probably be with us for the forseeable future.   &gt; the government we’re supposed to sympathize with in this fairy tale was so utterly useless and evil.  A line like this to me invalidates what ever was said as propaganda. The Tibetan government wasn't ""evil."" It did what it did because that's the level of development the society was at, and the rules with which it was structured to complete its tasks. Any basic understanding of Tibetan history would show that, but Tibet has been more or less closed to the outside world and the unfortunate fact of its histories coming out of either Beijing or Lhasa-oriented-Dharamsala gives us a less than stellar understanding. That said, there's a lot of literature out there that can give one a fuller and more compelte understanding if you're willing to wade through it all.   Speaking of which,   Sources:   *Tibet: A History*, by Sam Van Schaik  *Holders of the White Lotus*, by Alexander Norman  *The Water Horse and Other Years*, by K.

291	"The simplest way to think about it, maybe not the correct way, but the *simplest* is that ""Western"" and ""Eastern"" philosophy are different gardens. ""Western"" philosophy is often referred to as the ""Confluence of Jerusalem and Athens"" referring to the basis of Western Philosophy being the Logical schools of Socratic Philosophy and Judeo-Christianity.   There really isn't an ""Eastern Philosophy"" by contrast.  Comparatively, we *do* have large fields of Chinese and Indian philosophy, usually collectively referred to as ""Dharmic,"" though it'd be a false dichotomy to compare it with Western Philosophy as a kind of ""Confluence of China and India.""   ""Dharma"" in Sanskrit literally means ""Law,"" as in ""the law of nature."" When ""Dharma"" is referred to in Indian texts, it often refers to religion as a whole, but it's original meaning was in reference to the functioning of the universe. Indian philosophy, the Dharmic Philosophies we can largely* group together under the banners of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, is rooted in the Vedas. Hinduism grew out of adherence to the Vedas, Buddhism and Jainism as a rejection of Vedic authority. Both, however, still rely on the concepts of Dharma and all three share ideas about the cycles of rebirth and the cyclical nature of time and the universal creation and destruction. Buddhism (I cannot speak for Jainism) began its life as primarily oral and soon developed a tradition of texts much like its developing older sibling Hinduism, which spent much of its history relying on a few (albeit long) texts. As the three developed, Vedic religion into Hinduism and its many (many) schools, Jainism's two, and Buddhism's many (that can be grouped into three main groups: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana) so did scriptural and textural traditions.   Chinese philosophy can trace most of its roots from the *Yijing,* the Book of Changes. Kong Tzu (Confucius) and his followers famously studied it, Taoism is strongly rooted in it, and Buddhists were keen to adopt it into their own understanding and corpus. Even the Jesuit missionaries, when they saw the possibility of adding an empire's worth of souls into the Catholic Church, saw fit to understand and adopt the *Yijing* into their worldview. The Book is many things, but is most famously a divination text used to guide rulers and governors towards paths of righteous behavior and living, even if (especially if) decisions are difficult. Richard J. Smith writes that Chinese culture ""is"" the *Yijing.* Examination of the text's numerology points to a connection with Shang and Zhou Dynasty Bone Oracles, in which questions were inscribed on the carapaces of turtles and then burned in a way to produce cracks in the shell, which were then interpreted by diviners. These numbers correspond roughly to the imagery of the *Yijing's* gua**.   Without getting lost in the weeds, this was the earliest record of Chinese thought (and pretty early in general for the timeline of human writing) though the Shang and Zhou Dynasties did pretty well to annihilate turtles in China and so reliance on the *Yijing* and its interpretation grew. By the period of the Warring States, it was one of the few books that was universally regarded and one of the primary one that scholars took great lengths to study. See again, Kong Tsu's well known adherence and understanding of the *Yijing.*   To sum up, if we have three gardens of work, the initial seeds of Western Philosophy were Socrates and the Hebrew Prophets. The seeds of Indian Philosophy were the Vedas, which produced new varieties as well as reactions to their interpretation. The garden of Chinese philosophy was initially seeded by the *Yijing* which sprouted new varieties and interpretations. As the gardens grew and new plants grew, either as reactions to what was already there, or as offshoots and cousins of what came before them, trade routes became more developed and pronounced and the gardens began to experience cross-polinization. The Silk Road was first established between China and India and almost immediately Buddhism began to seep into Chinese thought. At first, a philosophy that shunned families and admired the cloistered ascetic, that was based in rebirth and couldn't comprehend the idea of an ancestral heaven was shocking and offensive to the Chinese, and remained solely an academic exercise. But slowly, it began to infiltrate and now the many East Asian schools of Buddhism are rooted in the Chinese Canon, translations of the Sanskrit originals. Meanwhile, similar processes have happened/are happening with the introduction of Western Philosophy to India and China, though we're quickly zooming out of my area of expertise.   Note that this doesn't touch at all upon Islamic Philosophy, or Southeast Asian Philosophy, to say nothing of the varies smaller gardens of native philosophies around the world. I'm a Tibetologist who's interested in Silk Road topics and deal frequently with the exchange of ideas across Asia.   **largely.* This is a basic overview.  **In English we usually use the term ""hexagram"" and ""trigram"" for images of six lines and three lines, respectively.

292	Only marginally. Oppenheimer's role is usually overinflated compared to Groves (who the scientists at Los Alamos despised). Oppenheimer's primary advantage was his ability to work with the hard charging Groves AND the scientists in New Mexico. Groves was the true Washington player,  but he brought Oppenheimer in from time  to time to deal with Bush and the Committee. In his role between managing the science effort at Los Alamos and the bigger Army program under Groves, Oppenheimer played a critical role, but the Manhattan was so much bigger than that.  The best accounts of the Manhattan project and it's main personalities are Richard Rhodes The Making of the Atomic Bomb and Robert Norris's Racing for the Bomb. Rhodes covers the science and Oppenheimer/Los Alamos piece well, Norris gets the bigger program and Groves.  A complete understanding requires both.	human

295	"Throughout college I read most of Snorri Sturluson's (1179 -1241) accounts of Viking oral history, which are really the only sources we have on their culture. They never wrote anything down. Even their complex code of laws was simply memorized by select individuals and passed down.   So, one of the massive novel sized ""poems"" Snorri wrote down to preserve Viking history was the Heimskringlaga, or the Saga of the Norse Kings. First of all, it is important to note that he was writing this a couple hundred years after Christianization in had occurred in Iceland (by Icelandic law in the year 1000). In the years before 1000 it had spread throughout Scandinavia, including Norway. Iceland was essentially a satellite state of Norway at that point because years of internal warfare had made that society begin to crumble. So thanks to external pressure and internal feuding over Christianity vs Paganism, the Vikings voted to officially switch to Christianity but permit Pagamism in private.   That brings us to the odd hybrid of Pagan and Christian magic/spirituality we find in some of the stories Snorri wrote down. It is true that he is a Christian writer trying to entertain a Christian audience, but also worth noting that Christian or not, Vikings were Vikings so they still behaved the same way. They just started asking a different God for the same old unsavory favors. Throughout the Heimskringlaga you'll find a few examples of Warriors praying to Jesus for ""victory"" over their victims, or treating cross necklaces like powerful magic amulets.   Christianity did not change Viking behavior. Their society was falling apart and was susceptible to outside influences. It is true that their brand of paganism was better for raping and pillaging, but that was pretty much over by the time Christianity arrived anyway. When Viking Paganism died the need for loot and glory did too (they were tied to power/influence and the afterlife). "	human

301	Another data point might be the supper at Emmaus described in Luke 24. In that passage, Jesus asks for food and eats a piece of broiled fish. (The KJV translation and some other manuscripts add a piece of honeycomb to the meal, so He is unlikely to be vegan.) If there were additional support for Jesus professing strict abstention from all animal flesh, one could gloss this as the resurrected Christ valuing the proof of material resurrection this meal provided over a previous refusal to eat meat, but that's a little shady to me and the sheer absence of comment on it elsewhere when multiple miracles would provide the occasion for it is striking.  So Jesus could be in modern terms a pescetarian, who abstains from meat other than fish -- but it seems more reasonable to believe that Jesus (the historical Jesus/the figure of Jesus presented in New Testament scripture) obeyed more or less the dietary restrictions of an observant Jewish man of his time period during his life. There are a couple controversies in New Testament texts related to what Christ's followers should and shouldn't eat (should they keep kosher? should they abstain from all meat?) and there's a school of thought that holds that the contention between James and Paul over dietary restrictions hinges on James wants believers to abstain from all meat (and dairy?), not the more conventional view that the disagreement is over whether followers must (or should, or can)  consume meat and dairy in the ways prescribed to people who keep kosher. That might be where this question originates from, and at least one early Christian source professes that James was not only a vegetarian but *raised* vegetarian by his parents (who were, in earthly terms, Jesus' parents, unless you subscribe to the perpetual virginity of Mary) but a lot of the modern sources identifying Jesus (or his followers) as strict vegetarians or vegans are from sketchy sides of the vegan blogosphere.	human

Despite their optimistic assumption that North Africa was to be in Allied hands by the end of 1942, the campaign was in fact to drag on until May 1943, a matter not helped by the steady breakdown of Allied air power following the Torch landings (and only rectified by February).	human

In the meanwhile, let me set you up with some quality answers from the past (straight from our lovely FAQ section!) to get you started!  To quickly answer you, the 'pike and shot' era was roughly what we call 'early modern era', a time of incredible social and political, not to mention technological upheaval in Europe (and the rest of the world). I'll let someone with a full set of credentials to go through the details, but check out these posts regardingwarfare at the time.  Here's one by /u/itsalrightwithme detailing what exactly is 'pike and shot'. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/330x89/how_were_the_corners_of_musket_protected_from/  Also by him, detailing the famous Swiss pikes. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3y0fbd/how_come_in_history_the_swiss_were_known_for/cy9hmtj/  From  /u/WhoH8in and /u/erictotalitarian, here's a good discussion on 'why did people just stand and shoot, are they stupid?' [paraphrased].  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/25mf4s/was_the_colonial_tactic_of_stand_in_a_line_and/   If these answer are helping, check out the rest of the collection on this topic here!  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq/militaryhistory/earlymodernwar  Cheers.	human
307	I once heard a story that one of the battleships at D-day was unable to elevate it's guns high enough for a specific target so the Captain ordered part of the ship flooded to raise the guns to a better angle.   Have you heard of this story? Is there any truth to it?	human
308	They used spotting and range-finding positions located away from the guns. For the Villerville battery, the range-finder was in a blockhouse converted from an old farmhouse. These positions were at a known range and bearing from the guns; ranges were found using optical rangefinders, then converting it into a range from the guns was a matter of trigonometry. 	human
309	I ran into a few sources that you might have fun with regarding the first question.  This one calculates the value of the Pound Sterling going back to 1264 using the tables from some books. Says it was over $170,000. https://www.uwyo.edu/numimage/currency.htm  But people made less money back then so I decided to check for prices of other things. I bumped into the following list of resources that cover prices in that period. http://libraryguides.missouri.edu/pricesandwages/1700-1779  This one here shows that butter was 7 pence a pound in New Hampshire. So converting 779 Pound Sterling to pence (240d/£) and converting to butter yields around 26,700 pounds of butter. https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106007458745;view=1up;seq=34  This is a half ton butter sculpture. https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Half-ton-butter-sculpture-unveiled-at-12474150.php  It was a lot of money.  And for comparison, I was able to find this indicating that Elihu Yale donated gifts which were sold for £800 https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elihu-Yale  According to that conversion page, this was around $180,000. It appears that donations of that magnitude were the going rate to get a school named after you.	human
310	Ho there, traveler, greetings and well met!  By full plate, I presume you mean something resembling a 'Maximilian plate'? (sample: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_armour)  Keep in mind. Those things only existed in a relatively small part of history.   Anyways, while you wait for a deeper response from a qualified historian, kindly check out this thread from our lovely FAQ regarding the effectiveness of plate armor, which I believe answer your question somewhat, if only as a sidenote.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1w4gbt/why_did_knights_still_use_swords_after_the/  Pinging /u/MI13.

311	I don't, off the top of my head, know of any such incidents happening on D-Day. However, this was a pretty common practice for increasing the range at which a ship could engage land targets - for example, [here's a photo of this being done with *Revenge* - later *Redoutable* - in 1915](http://www.naval-history.net/WW1Book-Adm_Bacon-Dover_Patrol-1-062.jpg). 	human
312	They were mostly done through field telephone lines, which were hard to listen in on, and generally tricky to cut. Most of the electronic warfare methods required the use of radio, and were used at a higher level - operational or strategic, rather than tactical. 	human
313	"There were a couple of methods. The first and large scale way to take an enemy trench line and fortifications was to have the offensive start off with a *creeping barrage* (also known as a *walking barrage*). Meaning the unit that was about to cross no-mans-land would get a shield of artillery fire, that would walk them towards the enemy trench. The artillery would first fire an opening barrage for a while on the enemy trenches, to hopefully kill the soldiers, or at least daze them. Then a second barrage would begin; the ""Creeping Barrage"". This is when the whistle and signal to go over the top would be sounded. The advancing troops would climb over the trench wall in to no-mans-land. They would get a screen / shield of artillery that would be highly coordinated beforehand and during the advance. This artillery would be shot right in front of the advancing troops. And as the troops advanced, the artillery barrage would advance with them, closer and closer to the enemy trenches. When eventually the artillery would start raining down on the enemy trenches again, killing, maiming, or dazing the enemy occupants. Then the offensive soldiers would jump in to the trench, usually with bayonets fixed to their rifles, spades, shovels, trench knives, pistols, and shotguns ready to go. This was close quarters, oftentimes hand to hand combat. And after the first wave of soldiers (or in the German's case, the Stormtroopers) had killed most of the enemies in the trench, a second supporting wave would come in, and help mop up, and fan out clearing the trenches. And that is one of the ways trenches were cleared. Of course *Creeping Barrages* had to be extremely accurate and precise, or else they would accidentally kill their own soldiers with friendly fire. So it was very dangerous. This was an allied method that was often employed, but both sides used this way to clear trenches.   The second method, and this was a largely German method, was through sneaky techniques. They would maybe drop smoke, or wait until the middle of the night, or whatever. Usually have little to no artillery support. They would send stormtroopers and engineers forward through no-mans-land. These soldiers would creep and sneak their way up to the enemy trench line. Then they would throw a ton of grenades, and satchel explosives in to the trenches. Taking the enemy by surprise. Then the stormtroopers would jump in, and with pistols, knives, shovels etc... would fight hand to hand and attempt to take the trench that way. Oftentimes the Engineers would use flamethrowers to burn out Allied troops. The first strikes were  Knocking out Machine Gun  and communication positions first. Then a second wave of supporting regular infantry troops would flood in, and clear the trenches.   Also gas was used similarly. But that's how many trenches were taken, from both sides, during World War I. Once tanks were really used, that also added another element in to the battle - with the biggest element being fear. Nothing like seeing a giant armored behemoth barreling towards you to make you turn tail and run. "	human
314	Hi there!   Without knowing what you would consider 'well known', it's a little hard to come up with examples. Where one might consider the 'creeping barrage' to be common knowledge, another might have only learned it by chance.   Anyways, AskHistorians typically takes a while to come up with a well thought-out answer, and to avoid re-inventing the wheel, let me show you a few past discussions that might be exactly what you're looking for.  Here's one that I think answers the main meat of your question. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/37epxy/i_kept_hearing_about_significant_infantry_combat/crm3z5r/?context=3  Complimenting that, here's a discussion on infantry charges and the logic behind them.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t77wz/we_have_all_heard_of_the_mass_infantary_charges/c4k7e10/  Here's another piece, regarding technological breakthroughs and military breakthroughs, pun intended. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2sggut/in_ww1_how_did_the_innovations_of_tanks_planes/cnpbdig/  All of these came out of our lovely FAQ section, specifically the Trench Warfare part, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwi#wiki_trench_warfare  Paging /u/NMW.

315	The only other one as far as I know would be in Welsh Culture where you have the Dragon as a national symbol, and myths with the Red Dragon of Wales defending the country against the white saxon dragon.  There was a general post on here about western vs eastern dragons a few weeks back that it'd be worth searching for that did a good overview.	human
316	I thought that was being done to obtain plunging fire, but given the low elevation of the R class turrets then, I can see it. I know the interwar refit of some ships included redesigns intended to increase max elevation, and the retrofit of bulges made this flooding a little trickier after WWI. Do we know if similar examples, notably Gallipoli, employed this operationally? 	human
317	I've answered this question a couple of times on a broader scale, most recently [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7q0spd/z/dsloq61). Most of the points apply to the Norse as much as to any other early medieval polity.  To say that their strain of Paganism made the Norse fearless warriors can imply quite incorrectly that Christianity *doesn't* have a similar martial outlook and concept of an eternal reward for martyrdom, a perspective that the sheer existence of the Crusades should readily dispell. Long before this, however, Christianity had a long history of 'soldier saints', from the more passive Roman soldiers martyred during the Dioclesian persecution, to the more aggressive Anglo-Saxon saints such as the 7th century Saint Edwin, who fell in battle against the Pagans. Asser's *Vitæ Ælfredi* paints Alfred's campaigns against the Vikings as a struggle by brave Christian warriors to defend their homes, and by extension all of Christendom, against a Pagan threat. After Alfred's decisive victory at Eddington, Guđrum, and by extension his army, converts to Christianity. Although this was most likely at spear-point, there is an implication, at least by Asser, that Guđrum accepts so readily because the completeness of the Christian victory tells him that their cause is more just and their god more powerful, and it is therefore in his best interests to convert.  Beyond this narrative, the standard reasons for conversion - particularly the bureaucracy and political control - still stand.	human
318	If you ever get the chance to visit (assuming you have not), do it. It's completely surreal. It is like being on a completely different planet. When I went, the tour guide said that the craters are only about 1/3 of the original depth due to them filling up with newly formed soil and eroding soil from the wind and rain over the years.	human

321	Since 1618 the dukes of Brandenburg (the hohenzollerns) had ruled Prussia in a personal union, with Prussia being outside the traditional limits of the Holy Roman Empire. At the time only two royal titles were permitted inside the empire. The King of the Germans which was helped by the emperor and the title King of Bohemia. Therefore to get around this the king made himself King in Prussia which was outside the boundaries of the empire. This creates the legal fiction that he was only sovereign over his Prussian lands while remaining subservient as elector under the empire in his Brandenburg lands. This same reason allowed Augustas II when elected king of Poland to retain the title king of Poland as it was outside the empire 	human
322	This was the *Revenge* launched in 1892, not the one launched in 1916, hence the rename to *Redoubtable*. She had several compartments temporarily flooded on several occasions, to allow her to engage the German positions on the Belgian coast, which were positioned too far inland for her to hit otherwise, or were covered by coastal batteries that could not otherwise be out-ranged. Installing bulges did not prevent or complicate this flooding; *Redoubtable* had  bulges installed in early 1915, before that photo was taken. In fact, by providing a water-tight compartment far from the centre of the ship, flooding them made a list easier to achieve. I'm not aware of any cases where this method was used to target hardened or obstructed positions.	human
323	Because modern battleships with high speed and far superior anti-aircraft defenses were needed to protect the carrier battle groups. Shooting at a beach? Any old battleship can do it. Use your weakest units for this purpose, saving your strongest for the battles against enemy surface fleets and carriers.  So yes, they were in the Pacific. The Italian and German navies were much smaller than the Japanese navy, so the most powerful naval units of the US were all deployed in the Pacific.	human

325	"If I may add, a little research shows that, in addition to Stonewall Jackson, Georgia Governer Joseph Brown advocated for the use of pikes in 1862.  *""Including those, however, which have and will be imported, in spite of the blockade, we have guns enough in the Confederacy to arm a very large force, but not enough for all the troops which have been and must be called to the field. What shall be done in this emergency? I answer: Use the ""Georgia Pike"" with six feet staff, and the side knife eighteen inches blade, weighing about three pounds.        Let every army have a large reserve, armed with a good pike, and a long heavy side knife, to be brought upon the field, with a shout for victory, when the contending forced are much exhausted, or when the time comes for the charge of bayonets. When the advancing columns come within reach of the balls, let them move in double quick time and rush with terrible impetuosity into the lines of the enemy. Hand to hand, the pike has vastly the advantage of the bayonet, and those having the bayonet, which is itself but a crooked pike, with shorter staff, must retreat before it. When the retreat commences, let the pursuit be rapid, and if the enemy throw down their guns and are likely to outrun us, if need be, throw down the pike and keep close at their heels with the knife, till each man has hewed down, at least, one of his adversaries.""*  I found this text at http://college.cengage.com/history/ayers_primary_sources/governor_brown_addresses_mechanics.htm, which cites *Allen Candler. The Confederate Records from the State of Georgia, Vol. II, 1860-65: State Papers of Governor Joseph E. Brown. Atlanta, Ga.: Chas. P. Byrd, State Printer, 1909. 199-201. *  "	human
326	Old battleships were used for shore bombardment in both the Atlantic and the Pacific, because the newer ones had a more important job: they were fast enough to keep up with and escort the aircraft carriers. As well as protecting against any surface threat, they were heavy AA platforms, vital for the air defence of the task force. During 1945, the British Pacific Fleet detached its fast battleships to join American ships for a number of bombardments against Japanese airfields and industrial targets - when the battleships were not with the fleet, the rate of successful air attacks on the carriers increased. Old battleships could carry out shore bombardment just as well as new ones.	human
327	There were well-developed systems for guiding naval firepower onto shore targets. British and American observers were overhead in RAF Spitfires and FAA Seafires, correcting the fall of shot. There were also forward observers on land and on ships closer to the target. The problem is that naval gunfire, fired from the unstable platform of a rolling ship, is not really accurate enough to hit a small target like an individual building at the ranges used.	human
328	"Thomas Piketty's 2014 opus, *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*, touches on some of the economic reasons behind the ""Japanese will eat us alive"" cultural trope. This trope is particularly noted in English-language media, which isn't surprising, for a single reason: World War II.  That massive conflict ended up causing massive economic and human damage, but the United States (and to a lesser extent, Great Britain) fared far better than the devastated Japan, France and Germany. That was bad for the people in those countries in the war's immediate aftermath, but it also gave an opportunity for rapid ""catch-up"" growth. Even today, you can see how developing economies grow far faster than mature, developed economies.  The trope you speak of wasn't merely a cultural one. It was also endorsed by a number of serious scholars and public commentators. Paul Kennedy's 1987 popular history, *The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers*, originally featured on its cover [an image](http://www.bookdoor.eu/uploads/bookdoor/t/2016/03/09-the-rise-and-fall-of-great-powers-c436e100fc7bc56d29f1d2d94310e7ae.jpg) of national representatives marching on a globe: Britain descending, America on top but taking its first step downwards — and Japan climbing into America' place on the top.   ""**Due to its immensely successful growth since 1945**, [Japan] enjoys a unique and very favorable position in the global economic and power-political order,"" Kennedy notes (p. 458, emphasis added). He elsewhere describes Japan as ""the most spectacular example of sustained modernization in those decades,"" in part because of how it coasted off the more advanced American economy, ""borrowing (and improving upon) sophisticated management techniques and production methods in the West"" while also benefitting from huge foreign investment (initially from American defense expenditures in the region) and low wages (416-7). Beyond its initial growth in manufacturing, Kennedy says Japan's ""achievements in the computing field are so well known as to be legendary,"" again in part because of ""borrowing heavily from American technology"" (462).    Summarizing elite consensus at the end of the 1980s, Kennedy writes that ""only a few dispute the contention"" that Japan is the economy ""best positioned for the coming twenty-first century.""^1 Beyond economic factors, he praises Japan's education system, savings rate, ""the very high quality of the Japanese work force"" (459-64).  ""Just how powerful, economically, will Japan be in the early twenty-first century?"" Kennedy asks. ""Barring large-scale war, or ecological disaster, or a return to a 1930s-style world slump and protectionism, the consensus answer seems to be: *much* more powerful... It is worth recalling that in 1951, Japan's total GNP was one-third of Britain's and one-twentieth (!) of the United States'; yet within three decades it had risen to be double Britain's and nearly half the United States'"" (467, emphasis in original).  Obviously many of these predictions about Japan's future dominance turned out to be slightly overheated. But it wasn't just inchoate nativist fear — lots of Very Serious People looked at stats in the late 1980s and came to the conclusion that Japan was overtaking the U.S. and Europe, at least economically.   Of course, Japan wasn't the only country to have this kind of catch-up growth. Many European countries similarly had a postwar boom; in France, they talk of the *trente glorieuses*, the Thirty Glorious Years between 1945 and 1975. Piketty argues that this massive European growth (when many western European countries were averaging more than 4 percent growth per year, compared to about 2 percent in North America) was ""quite simply because Europe had fallen far behind the United States over the period 1914-1945 but rapidly caught up during the Trente Glorieuses. Once this catch-up was complete, Europe and the United States both stood at the global technological frontier and began to grow at the same relatively slow pace, characteristic of economies at the frontier."" (Piketty, 96-7)   Of course, for the United States and Great Britain, being caught economically didn't necessarily feel so good or natural.   ""Between 1950 and 1980, the gap between the English-speaking countries and the countries that had lost the war closed rapidly,"" Piketty writes. ""By the late 1980s, US magazine covers often denounced the decline of the United States and the success of German and Japanese industry. In Britain, GDP per capita fell below the level of Germany, France, Japan, and even Italy"" (98).  By the 1980s, European growth had slowed, but Japan's boom was continuing. This was boosted by an [asset price bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble) that finally popped in 1992, sparking a huge and lingering financial crisis and contributing to much slower growth rates than Japan had seen in the 1980s and before.   ""During the 1980s, the value of private wealth shot up in Japan from slightly more than four years of national income at the beginning of the decade to nearly seven at the end,"" Piketty writes. ""Clearly, this enormous and extremely rapid increase was partly artificial: the value of private capital fell sharply in the early 1990s before stabilizing at around six years of national income from the mid-1990s on"" (172).  (By contrast, private wealth in the U.S. was about five times GDP before the 2008-9 Great Recession, in which it fell to four times GDP, ""a drop of roughly the same size as the Japanese correction of 1991-1992."" Piketty, 172.)  You can get a sense of this pattern in [this chart I made](http://dhmontgomery.com/files/gdp.png) from World Bank data, of (smoothed) annual GDP growth rates from 1960-2000. Japan grew far faster than key Western economies (and Britain somewhat slower) through the 1980s before steadily declining through the 1990s as the U.S., Britain and France picked up.   So the cultural moment you pick up on was dominated by real economic factors: Japanese economic success, both in its own right and compared to other developed economies. Experts looked at Japan and predicted that the massive growth it had seen over the past decade would continue into the future, an extrapolation that made them predict Japanese world economic hegemony. These predictions were shared with the public via the news media (those ""US magazine covers"" Piketty referenced). As it turned out, Japan's economy crashed and then stagnated in the 1990s, partly for structural reasons and partly because a share of its 1980s boom had been illusory.  ^1: Amidst his praise, Kennedy does note a few potential threats to Japan's economic preeminence: Western protectionism in reaction to Japanese success, the rise of other, lower-cost manufacturing countries in East Asia (China, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan), and its already evident demographic issues (""because of the age structure of its population, by 2010 it will have 'the lowest ratio of working-age people (those 15 to 64 years old) among the leading industrial nations,' which will require high social security outlays and could lead to a loss of dynamism"" (459-61).

Japan was the first nation to industrialize outside the ""Western"" world, starting from the Meiji Revolution. This economic growth accelerated during the post-war period. Economic growth rates were regularly upwards of 8% during the 1950s and 60s. From the 1970s and 80s onwards Japan went from being a maker of cheap textiles, bycicles, etc to a genuine innovator. Americans were buying Toyotas in stead of GM cars. RCI was clobbered by Sony. There was less visible erosion but just as important erosion in the position of the American shipbuilding and steel industries. Indeed, in 1987 Japanese GDP per capita exceeded that of the US after the Plaza Accords.   I suspect American anxiety went beyond just fear of economic competition. Anti-Asian racism has died down in terms of virulence, but it has historically been incredibly powerful. The internment of Japanese during WWII was just the top of a deep and bitter well. However, I think just as important was the sense that America's relative decline was the result of something wrong with America and the American way of doing business.   Japanese capitalism (keep in mind business in Japan is far from static and institutional structures have changed a lot over time) differed from American capitalism in many ways. The government , and especially the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI) played a much more prominent role in coordinating industry. While Japan is a democracy, a single party dominates politics, and real power is in the hands of the bureaucrats. Many Japanese companies cooperated instead of competed. Workers and manager worked hard because of their personal commitment, and the relations rather than contractual obligations. Japanese corporations considered maximizing shareholder value just one of many competing interests, rather than the primary motivation.   The fear and anxiety went away because it turns out the Japanese model was different, but it wasn't obviously superior. GDP per capita growth slowed down dramatically during the 1990s. Samsung and other Asian electronics beat Sony and Toshiba at their own game. Japanese firms have struggled in the new world of software design, and Japanese businesses struggled to adapt to current business patterns. Government debt as a share of GDP exploded as the government struggled to find answers to the new economic malaise. "	human

337	I think the OP wants to know why the Wettin family was granted a privileged title that the Hohenzollerns were not, i.e., what makes the Wettin family different?  King in Prussia was a title used 1701-1772. Meanwhile, two Wettins (Electors of Saxony) were kings of Poland (1697-1706, 1734-1763).  I'll defer to an expert on the subject, but the first Wettin king of Poland (Augustus II) converted to Catholicism, and Austria (i.e., the Holy Roman Emperor) supported his election to the Polish throne. That conversion was a big coup for the Emperor. Meanwhile, the Hohenzollerns/Prussians were generally in opposition to the Emperor, including being Protestant. So, my guess is that the Wettins were friends of the Emperor, and the Hohenzollerns were not. There might also be some kind of legal fiction about the Polish monarchy being an elected position, as opposed to an inherited one.	human

341	"So you seem to be under the impression that the senate was where legislation was passed, since you place the tribunician *intercessio* strictly within the senate but then talk about vetoing bills. Legislation in the Republic was written and proposed by magistrates and carried to the citizen assemblies, especially the tribal and plebeian assemblies (the centuriate assembly formally held legislative, as well as electoral, powers, but the former lapsed at a quite early date). It was traditional, though hardly legally necessary--as tribune in 232 C. Flaminius promulgated an agrarian bill against the senatorial review--to bring legislation before the senate for debate and review prior to an actual vote, as well as for public *contiones* to be held debating (or supporting, depending on how you think *contiones* worked) the bill--no actual debate was allowed at the assembly. The tribunician veto (*intercessio*, ""going between,"" a reference to the sacrosanctity of the tribune's person) applied not only to the assembly and the tribune's colleagues, but also against the actions of magistrates outside the tribunate and *senatus consultum*, which effectively gave the tribune the right (since the consuls ordered senatorial procedure) to veto discussion in the senate as well. But that does not imply or mean that the senate had formal legislative powers, and when we find tribunes exercising their vetoes against legislation (as, for example, M. Octavius did against Ti. Gracchus' agrarian bill) they are, naturally, at the citizen assemblies, the only place that legislation could legally be passed.  Your details on magisterial details are a little fuzzy. Collegiate veto was not restricted only to the consulship, but to all collegiate magistracies. Part of the problem with Sulla's increase in the number of elected magistracies was that the number of consuls was still only 2, which meant more people were competing for higher office and more friction was likely to occur. But another part was that more colleagues at each level below the consulship meant more chances for conflict between magistrates of the same level, who could prevent action by any of their colleagues. Collegiate veto was rarely exercised, and when it was it appears usually to have been the consular veto, but nevertheless it was not restricted to the consuls. Indeed, the tribunes (again, using M. Octavius as an example) could veto their own colleagues.   &gt;Was it that hard to ensure that one, single person from your faction was elected a Tribune, so that you could veto the kinds of bills you did not want?  So with this statement you're implying a model of the Republic which is heavily debated right now. In 1984 Fergus Millar published a very influential article called ""The Political Character of the Classical Roman Republic"" in which he said that basically Polybius' model of a tripartite constitution was essentially accurate, and that the Republican voting assemblies held a great deal more independent power than had previously been supposed. Prior to Millar the prevailing model had been one of strict, hierarchical top-down control, whereby the senatorial class exercised strict control over the voting assemblies via their networks of clients, and that all political power existed within the small circle of *nobiles*, with the citizen assemblies existing more or less as smoke-and-mirrors. That clientage model was already breaking down (Brunt dealt it some pretty major blows, and assaulted the reliance on prosopography that supported it), but Millar's article dealt the clientage model's death blow when it came to our understanding of the political ideology of the Republican constitution, to use the common shorthand. Against Millar, sometime later, Mouritsen published *Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic* in which he tried to demonstrate that though the clientage model was thoroughly obsolete nevertheless political power was concentrated in the hands of the *nobiles*, as a result of the inherent unfairness of block voting, the economic, temporal, and spacial limitations on the ability of most voters to assemble *en masse*, and the general lack of awareness of and interest in politics that Mouritsen saw in Roman society at large. Mouritsen's argument has helped sober perception of Millar's (especially since as time went on Millar got more and more taken away with his argument, eventually calling the Republic a ""democracy"" when he had explicitly stated in his original article that the Republic was not a democracy) but it's also caused some issues. Mouritsen's arguments about the difficulty that most voters had in assembling for the vote are reasonable, but he also argues that political ideology was essentially absent from the Republican system. Individuals might have had ideologies but, says Mouritsen, there was no underlying ideology in how the Republic was ""supposed"" to work, and in any case popular ideologies were manipulated by *contiones*, which Mouritsen sees as essentially rallies for one's own supporters, not true platforms for speech and debate. Pushing back on this one might read Morstein-Marx's *Mass Oratory and Political Power in the Late Roman Republic*, which reveals a lot of the flaws in Mouritsen's ideological argument.   The point of all this is to say that we should not think of the Republic as being groups of senatorial ""factions"" (*factio*, after all, is a rare word in Republican politics, and is almost always negative) vying with each other constantly over personal squabbles. Certainly this happened sometimes, and some events can be explained at least in part by appeal to the infighting of personal cliques, but it simply fails as an overall framework for the political system in general. Nowhere is the ideological framework of the Republic so apparent, perhaps, as in the tribunate. The tribunes were originally empowered, the tradition tells us, during an early constitutional crisis over the rights of Roman citizens. The tribunes formally acted as elected representatives of the interests of the people, and their *intercessio* was couched as the expression of sovereign popular will. They held sacrosanctity not because some priest gave it to them or anything, but because the magistrates swore an oath on taking office to respect the rights of the people and their champions in the tribunes. We can see a degree of this ideological argument when examining individual incidents. Take, for example, the abrogation of M. Octavius' tribunate by Ti. Gracchus. According to Plutarch, in defense of his actions Ti. appealed to constitutional ideology, stating that the people elected the tribunes to be their representatives and champions in places and positions they had no access to, and that the moment a tribune countermanded the will of the people he was no longer a tribune at all and must necessarily be removed from his office, in the same way that a consul could be deprived of his office by a tribune as a representative of the citizen assemblies. It is unclear why exactly Octavius vetoed the vote on Ti. Gracchus' agrarian bill (""the people"" is a rather nebulous concept, encompassing a lot of people with a lot of different interests), but, according to Plutarch's Ti., citing the right to the vote in particular, Octavius had implicitly violated his role as the executor of the people's will by refusing to allow them to hold a vote at all--if the vote *was* the manifestation of the will of the people, then how could preventing it from even happening possibly be a defense of popular sovereignty? Contemporaries, if we are to believe Plutarch, saw some of the flaws in this argument, namely that if tribunate sacrosanctity was not inviolable then theoretically the will of the people, as expressed by a tribunician veto, could be overridden. Thus Plutarch relates a story that T. Annius, before a speech *ad populum* denouncing him, asked Ti. whether, if he could produce a tribune to speak in his defense, Ti. would deprive that tribune of his office. Annius' argument, at least according to what Plutarch relates Ti. said in his defense, is pretty specious--Ti. argued specifically that the prevention of the vote was inherently against the popular will, and that this action deprived a tribune of his standing as a tribune--but nevertheless the ideological strain is there.   **CONT**"	human
342	 Brunt famously said that until Flaminius, but more accurately until the Gracchi, a tribune could always be found to veto something the senate didn't want. But while tribunes were either from senatorial families or were senatorial hopefuls, and thus perhaps inclined to defend the rights of their peers and not piss them off, there was quite clearly a sort of ideological baggage attached to the office that was taken quite seriously. M. Cato, whom everybody knows (somewhat erroneously) as this great old-fashioned fuddy-duddy stick-in-the-mud nevertheless as tribune in 62 passed a grain bill, and when sent later by Clodius to oversee the consolidation of Cyprus as a province, in order to ensure that money was secured for the popular *lex Clodia de frumentaria*, we're told unanimously that he carried out his work with great attention. Tribunician vetoes were not something to thrown around willy-nilly, nor were tribunician rights easily overridden. When they were people--not just the senate, but the actual citizen body, the *populus*--got very upset. In fact, despite Brunt's statement, we have surprisingly few references to tribunician vetoes at all before the Gracchi. Part of this must have something to do with the quality of our sources, but the evidence for the senatorial class or groups within the senatorial class dominating the flow of legislation or the actions of various magistrates with vetoes left and right is fairly slim. Why? There were, as you recognize, ten tribunes. If the later debates over tribunician power and responsibility are anything to go on, there was an important and implicitly--and explicitly!--recognized ideological burden that came along with the tribunate. This sort of ideology could be and sometimes was broken or stretched, but the balance of our evidence suggests that much more often than not it was taken seriously	human

For the 6 Day War, I'd look into what Soviet units were still using WWII era armor at the time or just before the war. A lot of this could have come from Soviet units who were just being outfitted with newer T-55 and T-62 tanks, especially 2nd line units.   According to ""Modern Armor"" by Pierangelo Ciati (1978), the Soviet Union developed the T-34/85 II in 1947 and continued producing it until 1964 with around 12,000 of this post war model built.

348	"In 1637 New England, John Harvard could have used his donation of 779£ 17*s* and 2*d* to buy 26,738 pounds of butter.  I'm not generally one for ""currency equivalents"" across centuries and space, since that doesn't really tell us anything about either purchasing power or purchasing *needs* in a given historical context. Fortunately, in this case we have some more useful data to judge against--yes, even more useful than the 46,791.5 pounds of bacon his descendants could have bought in 1653.  Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded to be a Puritan ""city on a hill"" and the future Harvard was to be its seminary. In 1636, its governing General Court thus authorized 400£ to go towards the establishment and construction of its seminary. Except there was one problem. Massachusetts Bay Colony didn't have 400£ to spare--that was actually a little more than they collected in taxes that year! The agreement, then, was to spend 200£ right away and 200£ once the school began operations (books, faculty, and so forth). Thus, John Harvard's donation either tripled or *quintupled* the money available to the nascent seminary.  And we shouldn't ignore the other half of his donation, either.  A full library was one of the seminary's biggest priorities, too. In terms of other early donations, one of the most significant was a collected 200£ earmarked for further book purchases.   Books might not seem like a massive expensive compared to, say, a building (unless they're published by Brill...). But this is where the realities of a *colonial* economy come into play. In the strictest sense, the colony-metropole relationship is one in which the colony is a producer of commodities with a primary/privileged economic relationship to the metropole. America grew things; Britain made things. Here those things included books.   North America's first printing press was established by Elizabeth Harris Glover (later Dunsten) in 1638, too, and that was just one press. Until that point, *all* books in New England had to be bought or brought from overseas (I'm not sure if book printed from New Spain's presses ever made it north), and let's remember that a printing press can only be cost-effective in *mass* production. Printing two sets of Calvin's *Institutes* isn't going to support anyone's family.  Furthermore, even with Glover and her printer Stephen Daye potentially hired to make more frequently referenced books for the seminary/college, replacement letter molds *and all the paper* still had to be shipped from England. At great cost, too--when her late husband Joseph made arrangements to bring his press to America from England, the Glovers actually brought more paper with them than their press itself was worth.   John Harvard could have done the things that rich people do with their money--buy nicer things than you have, not do the crummy chores that you have to do, and make more money. In fact, we know he did at least some of those, since his book collection was also quite significant. But in this case, he also played a big part in making the college eventually named after him happen."	human

355	"Interesting question. However, it doesn't have an answer you are likely to find appealing.  We don't know for certain because if atheists existed in New England during this period, they did so in silence and under the guise of being at least moderately religious. While religiosity  amongst Americans was extremely low by the time of the American Revolution's beginning in 1775, religious life amongst early American colonists were extremely high, especially in New England prior to the turn of the 17th century. The story of religious ""pilgrims"" landing at Plymouth in 1620 is akin to American mythology, this region was initially settled by folks who were deeply fundamentalist in their beliefs and were seeking a safe haven for people who held similar beliefs.   However, the story is actually more complicated than what most Americans understand today.  I'm going to then try to best explain this answer in two parts.  First, talking about what we know about religious and societal dissenters in New England society during this period.  Next, I'll discuss Atheism in the 17th century.  **Religious Dissenters in 17th Century New England**    Puritans who settled New England through the 17th century were very fervent in their religious beliefs and did not, in any way tolerate dissenters. It was not enough to simply be a ""Christian"" you had to be the right type of Christian who ascribed to the same beliefs as others living in those colonies.  This led to an extremely oppressive view of other types of Christians.  A good example of the intolerance that flourished under this is the way that Quaker immigrants interacted with New England's settlers.  Quakers, who were fervent in their own beliefs as well, came to the colony in 1656, and multiple Quaker 'leaders' (this is merely an informational title since Quakers claimed to have no religious leaders at all, but merely some members who were more vocal than others) were exiled from the state between 1656 to 1660.  Several of these leaders returned, some more than once, leading to harsh reactions from their intolerant neighbors, leading to violent arrests, floggings, and extended jail time where some Quaker prisoners were jailed in drafty cells without blankets or any type of warmth, leading to illness.(1)  The violence against Quakers in Boston and its surrounding areas peaked in 1659 to 1661, where Boston's religiously controlled government executed William Robinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, Mary Dyer, and William Leddra of Barbados.(2)   I feel like it is also worth mentioning that persecution against other denominations of Christians were not the only type of persecution that potential Atheists would have seen.  Laws against people who are gay also were rampant in New England during this period.   The [English Sodomy Act of 1533-34](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buggery-Act) declared the sentence of death for sodomy and bestiality and this law was essentially copied into the New England legal codes in 1648 Massachusetts. That said, records suggest that only one such execution ever took place in America during the 17th or 18th centuries, leaving such laws were largely unenforced.(3) A total of three people are known to have been executed for homosexual charges during the colonial period.(4) The main takeaway from this should be clear -- Puritans were not looking to accept people who were different, had conflicting beliefs, or wanted to live their life even marginally different than regular society.  They wanted conformity.   ** Atheism and Religious Beliefs in 17th Century New England**   So why do I mention all this about Quakers when you asked about Atheists? For several reasons. One, is that if a person who grew up in this society witnessed this level of persecution against other *Christians* than imagine what would happen to someone who was an apostate?  The other, is that during this period, the Enlightenment, which spurred new ideas into reflections upon religion, namely Deism and even Atheism was only in the beginning stages.  Enlightenment views of religion really would not spread to the Americans until the 18th century, and typically through notable figures like Ben Franklin ([whom some historians credit with being the person who brought deism to America](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/06/28/how-benjamin-franklin-a-deist-became-the-founding-father-of-a-unique-kind-of-american-faith/?utm_term=.75203fe74c20).) However, after the reformation in the 16th century, charges of atheism did start popping up (in some areas of the world it was rather frequent) and often times held a sentence of death.  But what was atheism back during this period.  I'll let historian Leif Dixon explain:  &gt;[During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the use of this label became more and more frequent, but its meaning was hard to pin down. On one level, the charge of ""atheism"" came as readily to the lips of 'orthodox"" early modern writers as ""communist"" did to some McCarthy-era Americans -- the term was aggressively elastic, a byword for personal enmity, cultural nonconformity, or political protests--and was thus a phrase of abuse that went well beyond the nominal confines of its technical definition... **The atheist was sometimes portrayed as a monster, but he could also represent the idea of a Judas, an enemy within, perhaps a friend, perhaps even oneself**]( http://www.jstor.org.proxy-bc.researchport.umd.edu/stable/23265536).  If there's one take-away that should be taken away from this quote, is that the charge of atheism was an easy charge to levy against someone during this period simply as a blanket term for anyone who could perhaps be untrustworthy. Remember, just a few decades after Massachusetts folks executed Quakers, they also conducted the [Salem witch trials](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-witches-of-salem) which saw the execution of women on anti-Christian charges.   As far as I've seen, there were only handful of charges of atheism levied in New England during this period and they likely could have all been dubious, and none came with a death sentence. (I only had one book at my disposal at the time of this answer, so I may have to dig a little a little more to get details if you desire them). It's also important to take to heart what I said above about atheism, in the way that we understand it today, was not something that was fully developed yet.  Skip ahead a century, to around the time of the American Revolution and then you'll start seeing self reported views of religion and God that seem much more agnostic or atheistic.(5)  Hope this answers your question.

359	"For vegetarian figures who were contemporaries of Jesus, the Essenes are important figures and reading about them might shed some light on the state of meatless living -- Josephus identifies the Essenes as eating no meat and performing no animal sacrifices, in addition to other distinctions (communal living, having neither servants nor slaves, etc.) There are also commentators who discuss implicitly-meatless descriptions of prosperity in Hebrew scriptures. Both James the brother of Jesus and the apostle Matthew have been described by Early Christian chroniclers and theologians as not partaking in meat/other animal products:  &gt;""the apostle Matthew partook of seeds, and nuts, and vegetables, without flesh"" (Clement of Alexandria)   &gt;""[James, brother of Jesus, called 'the Just'] drank no wine or other intoxicating liquor, nor did he eat flesh"" [(Hegesippus)](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/hegesippus.html)   But there's no such identification for the other apostles or intimates of Jesus -- not Jesus' other family members like his mother and father or other siblings, not Peter the fisherman, not any of the Marys or Marthas -- and as far as what the New Testament considered by itself says, there's no explicit discussion of abstaining from meat in itself.    In terms of Jesus as he's presented in scripture, arguments presenting Jesus as a vegetarian and in opposition to the consumption of all flesh require a lot of picking and choosing which aspects of scripture the author chooses to admit into their argument. To some extent picking and choosing which aspects of scripture should have a more direct bearing on theological discussions is part of what theologians do, but this is pretty shady when it requires discounting out of hand any passages that might contradict your thesis. I feel similarly about efforts to argue that Jesus strictly abstained from alcohol -- this requires arguing against practices that were commonplace in the ancient world, serious reinterpretation of specific scriptural passages, and ignoring specific events described in the Gospels in favor of events taking place outside the scope of the Gospels (in the case of meat-eating, descriptions of life in the Garden of Eden before meat-eating and descriptions of the pacifistic Messianic Age). In order to argue that Jesus partook in no animal products of any kind and didn't want his disciples to partake either, you have to ignore or seriously reinterpret:   - Mark 14:14, Jesus expressing a desire to eat the Passover meal with his disciples, and every other implicit or explicit mention of this - all versions of Jesus [feeding the multitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_the_multitude) (giving other people fish to eat)  - Jesus eating fish during the dinner at Emmaus  - Peter's vision in Acts 10 in which he's low-key exhorted by God Himself to eat a variety of animals, some maybe kosher and others overtly non-kosher like lizards and other ""creeping things"" (this occurs in a context that links the ""unclean"" foods Peter professes he abstains from to food the way uncircumcised non-Jews eat, or even otherwise-inoffensive food prepared or eaten in proximity to unclean food)  - Bonus round for writers who claim Jesus vehemently opposed any kind of harm to animals whatsoever: the exorcism of the Gerasene man mentioned in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke; Jesus subsequently sending the demons possessing the man into a herd of 2000 pigs that subsequently, John Darnielle's words, ""ran straightaway into the water"" and died.    Furthermore I have reservations about this interpretation (theologically as well as in my capacity as a historian) it requires a kind of secret vegan gnosis -- the premise that Jesus believed fervently in abstaining from meat, that his close intimates knew this, that abstaining from meat may in fact be critically important to ethical Christian behavior, but that only faint traces of this have found their way into canonical New Testament scripture as we know it and only those who have recovered this esoteric learning know the truth. That goes beyond scholarship about the historical Jesus' likely habits and stances, and into territory outside the scope of this subreddit. Serious reinterpretation is all well and good, but when the same stance appears in the ad campaign of an animal rights organization with an unambiguous ax to grind, or a vegan blog that doesn't cite specific sources besides ""early Christians accepted that James was a vegetarian"" (without even specifying which early Church writers attest to this and if they take everything else that specific early Church writer says about scripture as granted) those accounts should be approached with skepticism. Likewise, any source that tries to talk about modern-style veganism and vegetarianism in the New Testament without remotely acknowledging any other first-century Jewish dietary practices.   The Bible Christian Church of the 19th century believed Jesus was a vegetarian and practiced vegetarianism in his image; this was one movement alongside multiple overlapping vegetarian movements in 19th century Britain and America, both religious and non-religious. If you're interested in this view and the Bible Christians' reason for this stance, Adam Shprintzen's *The Vegetarian Crusade* gives an overview. One more recent text that advocates the view of Jesus as a vegetarian (and also in opposition to animal sacrifice) is Simon J. Joseph's *Jesus and the Temple: The Crucifixion in its Jewish Context*. [David W. Chapman's review of the book](https://academic.oup.com/jts/article/68/2/737/4065201) outlines some of the issues (I almost said ""my beef"") I have with the book's modern iteration of a similar argument. Basically, there's a long history for this one in terms of interpretation and additional scriptural commentary, so the idea of Jesus being a vegetarian or vegetarianism as an acceptable or indeed desirable way of life for Christian followers of Jesus wasn't invented yesterday. But Jesus actually being a vegetarian is not a mainline view for the reasons outlined above and I am skeptical of any interpretation of Scripture or additional historical material that comes from an overtly polemical place regarding the superiority of vegetarian diet.

But, their undergarments protected their clothing from suffering from body sweat, because they covered the body more substantially. If you mean  the wealthy/royalty, then it was more regular, but it would really depend on what their schedule held. If they were holding audiences, or going to balls, or entertaining, etc. It's not a precise answer, but hopefully it helps.	human

363	Coldsteeleyes explained that rather well, I think.  The Kingdom of Poland was not in the gift of the Holy Roman Emperor. If you were elected by the Sejm, then you were King of Poland, simple as that. The Holy Roman Emperor might have refused to recognize it, thereby probably starting a war (as other powers sometimes did). But short of that, he had no say.  In contrast, the Elector of Brandenburg was seeking a new title within the Empire and without foreign legitimation. This was under Imperial jurisdiction and the Emperor would not be well disposed to granting other people the title of King. However, the Elector's lands in Prussia were not in the Holy Roman Empire. Thus the Elector declared himself King in Prussia, again where the Emperor had no (or at least considerably less) say.	human
364	Thank you for the positive response! I agree that histories of cultures less well attested or less intensively studied than the Greek tend to suffer from people trying to apply (often outdated) paradigms from Greek history to the scant evidence available. When fields start to assert themselves as specialisms in their own right, these theories often go out the window, as it's realised that the conditions in which other historical cultures did what they did is actually quite different. (This is also why I wouldn't dare question your account of Phoenician settlement practices!)  In terms of overseas settlement, Athens is a special case. They don't seem to have participated in the moves to settle the Western Mediterranean or the Black Sea; most settlements in these areas were later claimed by Phokaia, Chalkis, Eretria, Corinth and Miletos. The Athenians instead claimed to have initiated the so-called Ionian Migration, which is a nebulous early phase of resettlement which dotted the coast of Western Asia Minor with Greek communities. After this, they never send out settlers of any kind until the Classical period, when their foundation efforts take on a clear imperialistic form. The settlements at Nine Ways, Amphipolis, Brea and Thourioi (the latter of which was a joint venture in which even famous people like Herodotos took part) were clearly attempts to settle Athenians in strategic locations. However, it's right around the same time that the Spartans (with Herakleia in Trachis) and the Corinthians also start to assert their hegemony over their own settlements, instead of allowing them to be fully autonomous. I'm not sure if there is a specific instigator here or if the greater coercive and administrative power of Greek states generally allowed them to become more assertive in their relationship with overseas settlements. 	human

""Hard-wash days"" -- typically Mondays -- provided some of the most unpleasant memories for tenement housewives such as those in the Five Points. Mothers bribed children with candy money on wash day to keep them out of the house so they could devote their full attention and the entire space of the apartment to the arduous task at hand. They first made numerous trips up and down the stairs to haul water up from the yard. Then they heated the water on the stove and set to work scrubbing.  &gt;Drying the was was actually the most dreaded task. There were many options, all involving some risk.  (*Five Points: The 19th Century New York City Neighborhood that Invented Tap Dance, Stole Elections, and Became the World's Most Notorious Slum*, by Tyler Ambinder. Free Press, 2010, p. 84)  Ambinder's chapter on how Five Pointers live is worth the price of the book alone. Bear in mind that the rarely-washed clothes (which often became dirty again as they were drying) would have been much dirtier than the clothes in your laundry hamper, as they were exposed to the all-pervading filth around the wearers, from streets and yards soaked in sewage and buried under garbage and offal, to buildings filled with vermin and mold, to bodies that were rarely washed (in part because, again, baths were arduous and expensive).  Finally, it's also worth noting that doing laundry was painfully difficult even in the summer months. In the winter, it was often not worth doing at all."	human

369	In a nutshell - that was by design, but there were other factors in play as  well.  Anti-military stereotypes played a factor, along with some elitism and academic snobbery (Groves was an engineer), some of it goes back to the cultural divide between the academic/scientist and the engineer/military officer, but personality and organizational dynamics played the chief role.  Groves had an abrasive no holds barred personality and approached things like an engineer and a military officer is trained and conditioned to. The scientists at Los Alamos were used to a collegial, collaborative atmosphere (though they were fiercly competitive). They debated, discussed, and dissected. Groves made decisions - black and white, yes or no. Decide, order, monitor, act. Groves was the center of the OODA loop of the Manhattan project.  Basically New Mexico and the  Army/Groves had different cultures, different methods, and different roles to play and that produced friction.   Groves saw problems to be solved and expected people to solve them and didn't tolerate fools or failure.  He didn't have the time or patience to spend endless hours debating the finer points of nuclear physics.  Scientists on research projects are more like cats, they tend to chase off after shiny objectives and serve their own research interests whenever given the opportunity to do so.  Oppenheimer was the chief cat herder and had a sort of tacit agreement with Groves that allowed Oppenheimer to shift blame for unpopular orders or restrictions to the Army and Groves - Groves was willing to be the bad guy if it helped Oppenheimer get the job done and keep Los Alamos on task. There are a couple great scenes in Fat Man and Little Boy with Paul Newman in the role of Groves, that shows some of this dynamic with Oppenheimer, BTW. Newman did a lot of research for that role and captured him well.    I should note, Groves was abrasive, and made plenty of enemies in the military too, but the scientists underestimated him continually (Oppenheimer was one of the only ones who did not).  Groves literally carried around most of the details of the Manhattan project's vast enterprise in his head and was one of the only people who knew the full extent of the effort. Norris captures that (and a whole lot more) in his book. It really is a must read on the subject. Groves is a background figure in most historical accounts, Norris's contribution was to put him back in the center were he actually was. 	human
370	A chrome crash ate my first reply, so apologies for the delay!      Thank you so much for this awesome reply, this is fantastic! I've got a lot to consider.          Initially I wanted to start in 878, but after some reflection I think the best route will be  to attempt to mirror the starting conditions of the 'vanilla' Dux Britanniarum game in which the Saxons have no starting territory, and must raid to accumulate wealth, men, and reputation before being able to claim land. That seems like a solid choice and moves starting campaign conditions closer to parity. Some googling shows the first viking raiders to winter in England around 840-851, so I might pick a time in that range, which seems like a somewhat comparable to stage to 410-450 and the Saxon migration/invasion (unless I'm just horribly off haha).      I had no idea about the wics being created in the 700s, they will definitely need to be taken into account! Thank you once again, this has helped me a lot, and I was beginning to despair!      I've been reading Cornwell's Saxon Stories, and though I'm thoroughly enjoying it, I'm worried that it's skewing my perception of the period, as I'm trying to learn the actual history at the same time as I'm enjoying the fiction. This crossing of the streams is causing me to second guess myself a lot! 	human
371	Flagship and mobile AA platforms. Carriers have the problem that they routinely have to be turning into the wind and speeding up to conduct flight ops. If the admiral needs to be elsewhere or wants to it makes sense to be on a different vessel. The additional space gained from being on the battleship also aided in staff function.  While consider that an Iowa represented 4 Fletcher's worth of 5in guns without even counting the smaller mounts of 40 and 20mm guns. In fact in August of 1942 at the Eastern Solomons there was real concern on the carrier Enterprise that the escorting battleship North Carolina was in danger and burning from the volume of fire coming from her AA batteries. This being the first time a fast battleship accompanied a US carrier force into battle.  While finally there was the slim but still real possibility that the Fast Carrier Force could clash with the remaining IJN heavy surface units.	human

373	"The question essentially boils down to ""why did the Hohenzoller only call themselves King IN prussia"". The Wettins called themselves ""King in Poland"" because that was the traditional title.   But why then would the Hohenzoller create a title called ""King in Prussia""?   One thing that was mentioned, the Kaiser didn't want to make the impression that he would ""create""  a royal title within the Empire (which could be seen as a loss of authority of him); the Elector, on the other side, wanted the title to underline that he was more than a mere *Reichsfürst*,  a potentate under the Emperor, that he was a powerful monarch in his own right. And Prussia was, as others said, not within the Empire, so why not take it as basis for the new title?   In the end, the Elector paid a lip service to the seniority of the Emperor ""as highest monarch of Christendom"", which was even then a shallow phrase and had no legal rammifications.   And it was made clear that the Elector created a new title outside of the Empire, which the Kaiser only acknowledged. The Kaiser mainly had to accept this because it was clear that he would soon need the help of Prussia in the War of the Spanish Succession, the agreement between the Kaiser and the Elector (the *Krontraktat*) specified that the Elector had to support the Kaiser with 8000 men, and the Kaiser would help the Elector to get international and national (within the Empire) recognition. The King of Poland, August II., der Starke (who was a Wettin and Elector of Saxony) had certainly other things to do than to cut down Prussia; he was busy fighting against Sweden and outpoliticking the Sejm, in both things he was ultimately only moderate successfull.  The Hohenzoller were not forced to use the title ""King in Prussia"". They chose to. The ""in"" had a very specific ""plausible deniability"". In 1701, the Prussia you presumably know from maps didn't exist. It was divided into the Dukedom of Prussia, the eastern part, the one the Hohenzollern ruled.    And the western part, ""Royal Prussia"" (""Preußen Königlichen Anteils""), which the Deutsche Orden had lost in 1454 in a rebellion which promptly acknowledged the King of Poland as their liege. The following Thirteen-Years-War ended 1466 in a defeat of the order, it had to accept the loss. And what a loss it was, the order lost not only the castle of the Hochmeister, the Marienburg, but also Danzig. The newly founded West-Prussian state territory was ruled in union by the Polish King.   And that still was the reality in 1701. While the Hohenzollern ruled most of Prussia, the Polish King still was ruling in some parts of Prussia.   If Friedrich would have called himself ""King of Prussia"", it could have been understood as an implicit claim to those areas in ""Royal Prussia"", which was a thing he and his immidiate successor avoided.   His grandson (Friedrich II.), however, would later annex those areas (among others) in the first partition of Poland in 1772, and would afterwards call himself ""King of Prussia"".  As /u/coldsteeleyes before me, I used Iron Kingdom as source for this post."	human

379	Hi! Actually, it's a bit of that whole 'Brazil and the rest of LA are different worlds'  In particular the Cobras Fumantes are more of a big deal in Brazil - after all, Brazil was well-aligned with the Allies, declaring war on the Axis on 1942. U-boats even sank Brazilian merchant ships. Popular opinion was skeptical - thus the 'Cobras Fumantes' name - but supportive, and even now they are a point of national pride.   Argentina, however, only declared war to the Axis on 1945, and that only under a lot of international pressure. The battle of River Plate was something seen as foreign to Argentina, a war between imperialist powers, and it is not a particularly well known episode of history. What does receive a lot of attention - and many a scholar investigation, my favourite of which is [this one]8https://www.casadellibro.com/libro-la-autentica-odessa-la-fuga-nazi-a-la-argentina-de-peron/9788449313295/868291) - is the (shameful) role of the Peronista government in bringing Nazis from exile.

380	I grew up on Cornwell's Sharpe series, and I really enjoy the *Last Kingdom* adaptation of his Saxon stories—but you're right to be a bit skeptical. Most popular wisdom on this period paints it as a time of religious and ethnic conflict.  Popular understanding today is really shaped by the priorities of scholars in the 1990s, when the role of ethnicity and religion in conflict was coming under close scrutiny (e.g. Kosovo). Earlier understandings had been shaped especially by a concern for states and economics—which were priorities of the Cold War—and before that, there was an intense concern for nation-states, which just so happened to correspond to the European age of nation-building in the 1800s.  The maps that scholars draw often reflect the periods that they're in. Scholars around the period of WWI thought that the medieval world could be divided into [nation-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptarchy#/media/File:Anglo-Saxon_Heptarchy.jpg), just like their own world. Today, we create [different](https://www.mysociety.org/2014/04/15/mapping-the-vikings-influence-on-uk-place-names/) kinds of [maps](https://jalapic.github.io/vikings) that are more pointillistic, and they're not too different from maps being produced of [current conflicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war-israel-golan-heights.html), focusing on centers rather than on borders.  At any rate, if you're into the period and want a few good reads, I'd strongly recommend either Robin Fleming's *Britain after Rome* or Guy Halsall's *Worlds of Arthur*. Both offer a picture of the early medieval world that's more deeply rooted in archaeological evidence than in the priorities that 20th-century historians read into their interpretations of the sources.	human

385	"You're welcome and thank you for the second informative response. I'm also *no* expert on Phoenicia; I just keep better informed on what the actual experts are writing due to particular interest.  From what I've read just today, historians studying the Greek and Phoenician colonization projects have actually encountered both strikingly similar quandaries: such as a loaded modern vocabulary which muddles nuanced understanding (Maria Eugenia Aubet and colleagues like Tamar Hodos also struggle with the term ""colony,"" but they unfortunately don't have as complete of a compilation of Canaanite to be able to flesh out our modern descriptions) and have undergone similar revisions: Phoenicization, like early Hellenization, is now seen as less of a one-sided, intentional enterprise but a fairly organic  interaction between the settlers and their neighbors, and the transition of colonies from port-of-calls and trading posts to settlements is seen as less abrupt, more gradual.   If you have any time and interest, I also has a question kicking around in my head about the actual field of Ancient Greek History:  Let me know of I'm completely off-base, but I'm curious if you've ever noticed a tendency for Classicists, moreso than other specialists, to develop something of a chauvinist complex towards ""Western Civilization"" both today and throughout history, as though perhaps exposure to so much Hellenic genius, coupled with the exciting notion that the modern democracies constituting ""The West""  are the descendents and heirs to this genius, makes them ... go a little nuts, or perhaps individuals who begin their education believing in a West made great by an unbroken transfer of institutions and ideals from Ancient Greece to D.C. are prone to feel more at home studying the Classics.   (I now have to admit that this question is almost certainly spurred by my semi-annual hate-read of Victor Davis Hanson, and that Mary Beard, maybe the most famous Classicist alive, is a prominent counter to the trend I'm trying to describe.) Sorry if this question is annoying or needling; I don't want to cast aspersion on your field, but it's interesting to consider how the work culture unique to historical disciplines might affect how historians interact and collaborate."	human
386	To add to those answers, one reason for the use of shields was because of the introduction of polearms to counter plate armour. Polearms (such as a poleaxe, warhammer etc) worked by delivering blunt trauma, which plate amour couldn't mitigate as well as it could a cutting edge.  A shield could protect you from such a weapon, directing the energy into the shield rather than into the armour directly on your body. They wore padded jackets under the armour (called a Gambeson or Aketon, or just a padded jack) to help pad against blunt trauma and spread/absorb the energy, but it's always better not to get hit, rather than hope your armour will stop the blow, especially as polearms could break bones through armour.	human

392	"&gt; The Mountbattens found a legal loophole, that allowed for them to basically take the matter to court. They won. The two houses, at least when it comes to Queen Elizabeth II's decedents, Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince Henry etc... were merged in the early 1960s in to ""Mountbatten-Windsor"". That is the technical name / house for the royal family.  Please provide sources.  The sovereign is the fount of honours in the UK and can decide on royal surnames and house names, as in the [proclamation of 17 July 1917](http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#German_titles_1917).  I have never heard of a hint of such a court case, and I know of nothing in British law that would allow it to succeed.  That statement conflates house and surname.  Elizabeth II's proclamation of [9 April 1952](http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#Apr_9_1952) continued the situation in her father's time:  &gt; I and My children shall be styled and known as the House and Family of Windsor, and that My descendants, other than female descendants who marry and their descendants, shall bear the Name of Windsor  Note that the house/family and the name are separate clauses.  She changed in the proclamation of [8 February 1960](http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#1960):  &gt; Now therefore I declare My Will and Pleasure that, while I and My Children shall continue to be styled and known as the House and Family of Windsor, My descendants other than descendants enjoying the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness and the titular dignity of Prince or Princess and female descendants who marry and their descendants shall bear the name of Mountbatten-Windsor.  The first sentence: The house and family name remained Windsor.  The second sentence covers the surname ... but as has been noted by commentators, it's weird, because those with the style of Royal Highness and title of Prince/ss don't *use* a surname in proper etiquette.  But she asked the acting prime minister, and the [reply](http://www.heraldica.org/faqs/britfaq.html#p2-1) was  &gt; The effect of Your Majesty's Declaration is that all the children of Your Majesty who may at any time need a surname have the surnames of Mountbatten-Windsor.  But the current descendents with the style/title has signed using a surname Mountbatten-Windsor at least three times: Princess Anne's first wedding, Prince Andrew's wedding, and the banns for Princess Anne's second wedding.  At Charles's first wedding, he signed it more properly ""Charles P"".  (I think he could also have signed ""Wales"", ""Cornwall"", or ""Rothesay"".)  &gt; Either way, both the Windsors and Mountbatten's are actually not overly British in heritage, but mostly German  That is not relevant to the original question, but I hope that I can [note](https://xkcd.com/386/) briefly:  Elizabeth's mum was firmly British (her grandfather the 13th earl played cricket for MCC in the 1840s; I am puzzled to know how to be more British), so ""mostly"" can't be true.  For Elizabeth's father's (George VI) side: his mother (Mary of Teck) was born in 1867 and raised in England.  *Her* parents were born in Croatia (albeit of Germans) and in Germany, so yes, there are Germans in her background ... if you look past 150 years of residence."	human
393	A breakwater is a structure used to create an area of calm water, protected from waves or weather, especially around harbours. Following D-Day, the Allies constructed two artificial harbours on the beaches at Arromanches and Omaha Beach. These so-called 'Mulberry Harbours' used concrete pontoons and obsolete ships to form harbours capable of unloading ships. The obsolete ships were scuttled to form breakwaters for the harbours, while the pontoons formed piers and jetties. *Centurion* and *Courbet* were both used for this task - being scuttled, they were completely immobile.	human
394	"We have to readjust our mindsets a bit here: people didn't necessarily need to launder all of their clothes the way we do today. Instead, it was normal (for more than a thousand years - my knowledge isn't so encyclopedic before about 1500 or so, but I know of this tradition going back at least to the Anglo-Saxons) to wear a fairly plain garment under the clothing that could be seen, in order to protect it from the sweat and oil of the body. Men's shirts and women's shifts of the 18th century were made of linen, usually cut in fairly basic geometric shapes that made use of the woven selvage of the fabric to form unfrayable straight lines, and sewn together with firm stitches that would hold up to repeated rough laundering. [Shirts](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/159171) were made with a standing collar that protected the neckcloth, and sleeves that went to the wrist underneath a coat; women's [shifts](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/126841) instead had a lower neckline cut out of the body, to match the neckline created by the gown and stomacher worn throughout most of the century, and shift sleeves didn't go much past the elbow, as long sleeves were not typically worn by women.  These pieces were made out of linen at all different levels of quality, from very fine and almost sheer cloth to unbleached tow that would have to be broken in somewhat through both laundering and repeated wear to be comfortable. These comprise some of the earliest types of ready-made clothes, since they didn't have to fit the body in a more than cursory way, though they were also often made at home by women who may not have had the skills to cut out the pieces for more close-fitting outerwear made from more expensive fabric, and could be bought at second-hand clothes dealers (who were plentiful in cities and cheap).  In the early 19th century, cotton began to edge out linen as, very basically, cotton production was overtaking it. With slave labor and the cotton gin, the fluff itself was cheap and easy to process, while linen required ""retting"", i.e. being allowed to rot in water for a certain number of weeks, followed by a combing with metal ""heckles"". The American textile mills of this period were largely set up to deal with cotton, and those of England were trending that way themselves. Cotton then became cheaper than linen (though it had been affordable for a very long time already), and made more sense for use with these undergarments. There isn't a strict correlation, but as cotton became more commonly used this way, the cuts of the undergarments themselves changed to be less chary of waste. The ""Corazza shirt"" for men appeared in the 1840s; it was very different from the previous type, as it buttoned down the back and had an arrangement of pleats in the front, which likely is related to the growing trade in ready-made clothing that was more complex/difficult to make than those that were done at home. (Elizabeth Gaskell wrote of a woman dealing with ""the puzzle of devising how [Corazza shirts] were cut out"" in the 1851 *Mr Harrison's Confessions*.) Shifts - now called chemises - took on a number of different forms that often involved gathering to a yoke and the insertion of cheap machine-made laces or machine-embroidered ribbons. However, though they were fancier, they were still intended to be unseen and to be replaced and washed as needed.  Okay, so, what does ""as needed"" mean? That's tricky, because we can't tell from the extant pieces of clothing, and it wasn't regularly discussed. In the early modern period, there's evidence that people began bathing less specifically because they could have more changes of linen, which took care of the issue. (See ""The Body, Appearance, and Sexuality"", by Sara Grieco in *A History of Women in the West: Renaissance and Enlightenment Paradoxes*, Harvard University Press, 1992, if you don't believe me.) Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the ideal was to change at least every day, perhaps more often if one had gotten sweaty doing something physical or if the day were hot - having clean clothes made you more comfortable, obviously, and having crisp, fresh linen around the neckline of your clothes or peeking out from your sleeves was a symbol of both your social status and your moral standing - fiction and non-fiction of the 18th century takes note of the state of individuals' linen, drawing conclusions from the contradiction between someone's greasy, dirty shirt and other fine things they might have. Dirty linen was also thought to cause or attract illness by trapping impurities and ""poisons"" next to the skin.  The majority of people had a decent number of changes of body linen in their wardrobes, because these items were a necessity. In late 18th century France, for instance, three-quarters of the people in the bourgeoisie and artisan classes owned between ten and thirty shirts or shifts. Garsault's 1771 *Art of the Linen-maker* described a noble trousseau containing *72* shifts, which would allow for multiple changes per day as well as several to wear while others were being laundered! The very poor, however, might own only two shirts/shifts, wearing one while the other aired out or sat - or just one, if they were truly destitute. Paupers were typically given an outfit containing only one shirt or chemise upon entering a charitable institution, and they would rewear them until given fresh ones; as the laundries in these places were often inadequate, the ""clean"" one might not be much better than the one they were already wearing.  With outer clothing, there was not much objection to wearing the same thing repeatedly as there wasn't an implication that the proper laundry wasn't being done: the only issue might be that you appeared to have few items of clothing, which obviously would show your class/wealth. However, it's likewise difficult to say exactly how frequently individual coats, breeches/trousers, or gowns were worn, since inventories made after an individual's death rarely make it clear which clothing has been held onto for sentimental or other reasons, and which were actively being used. The 1747 inventory of the clothes and accessories of Mary Churchill, 2nd Duchess of Montagu, for instance, tells us a lot and a little. She had 25 shifts (probably all in regular use, since there would be little reason to hold onto worn-out ones) and 27 gowns of various fabrics, from seersucker to silk - were half for winter and half for summer? Were many held onto from her early life, or were they in regular rotation? We don't know. Barbara Johnson, an 18th century Englishwoman, kept an album with snippets of all of the fabric she purchased and had made up into clothing, usually with a note of the year and what was made, which is both useful and unuseful in a similar way: we can tell her habits of *consumption*, but not how often she got rid of or remodeled anything. When she bought two new mourning outfits in 1759, was she wearing those two day in and day out, or did she still have and use her mourning outfit from 1756, or the one from 1753, or even the ones from 1751?  We do know that many people, particularly in the 19th century, might change their outer clothes more than once a day. To quote from [a recent answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7j5g06/why_dont_we_brush_our_clothing_anymore/dr471w5):  &gt;The average man didn't really do any changes, while an affluent businessman might change out of his three-piece suit for dinner. For women, housedresses (loose, unlined, washable dresses) were very common during this time, and even an average woman would probably wear one while doing the housework to spare her normal clothing, which she could change into in the afternoon; moving up the social scale, an affluent woman might wear a housedress early in the morning, change into a different dress for the bulk of the day, and put on a dinner dress at night. Anything else would be put on on an as-needed basis, the same way that people do today - sports clothes for sports, riding clothes for riding, swimsuits, etc."	human

403	The difference RPC makes is shortening the time between fire control plotting a solution and the guns being able to fire with the solutions, as well as taking another layer of human error out of the firing process. In calm waters, where the bearings of the ship and the target are holding constant, RPC does not make that big of a difference. Where it really counts is when the ship is maneuvering, the target is maneuvering, and when crews are tired and unable to perform as well.  The best demonstration of RPC in action is in the Battle off Samar. American destroyers equipped with fire control computers and RPC were able to make numerous hits on Japanese ships while maneuvering to evade fire themselves. For a example involving capital ships, the HMS Duke of York was able to land shots on the KMS Scharnhorst in extremely rough seas while giving stern chase.	human

410	"Good afternoon, First of all, my field of study is focused in Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages social, economic and religious issues from the Mediterranean expanse, although I have studied some Northern European features from this era (ex: the trade relations between the Norse and the Arabs/Muslims) I don't feel confident enough to provide a clear academic answer about the Vikings topic. So, let's move ahead to the Roman-related question.  ""About romans, do you think adopting Christianism was a political decision made by the Emperor to instill fear (of hell) in the populations and better be able to control them?""  Keep in mind that when the Edict of Thessalonica (380), the one which made Christianity the state religion long after having been granted its legalization by Constantine (313), was promulgated the (formerly clandestine) ecclesiastical organization and the networks of contacts between bishoprics were already existing, all weaved during 3 centuries of persecution. So, the intricate inner hierarchy/organization of the church should not be seen as a brand new invention made up by the Roman state bureaucracy or by the reigning lineage. To a certain extent, emperors decided to join an already existing ""club"", where the role they would play would vary in each half of the empire. Now here's the tricky part, while the separation of the church and politics developed into something homogeneous in the Eastern Roman Empire, the western counterpart experienced the opposite effect: the more time passed, the more power the church achieved and the less the influence the emperors was able hold up towards religious affairs. For example - prior to the political split - after ordering the Massacre of Thessalonica (390) the emperor Theodosius was excommunicated by the bishop of Milan, Saint Ambrose, and was only readmitted after completing several months of penance, thus making evident that despite having the political rule over the Romans, he did not have the spiritual primacy which corresponded to the church (and later to the pope).   Conclusively, I find a bit difficult for a Western Roman emperor to had used Christianity as a tool to rule since he wouldn't have had a total control over it. Actually, I am inclined to think that if - somehow - an emperor decided to embrace Christianity with all his soul just to have a better control over the population's fears, he would have probably found out that an archbishop or the same pope would have got ahead of him.  Well, this is my first Reddit message, I hope it has been helpful for you."	human

415	I think you're looking at 'Königgrätz' rather than 'Königsberg'.  Anyway, for particular wars consider Geoffrey Wawro or Michael Howard on the Franco-Prussian War, *Rising Sun and Tumbling Bear* by Richard Connaughton on the Russo-Japanese War, *The Destruction of Lord Raglan* by Christopher Hibbert on the Crimean War, or just about anything reasonable on the US Civil War. Königgrätz may be easily dismissed at first, but either Wawro's *The Austro-Prussian War* or *The Road to Königgrätz* by Quintin Barry are very much worth considering for far more detailed narratives and analyses. Indeed, Wawro clearly discounts the idea that the needle gun alone was responsible for Prussian victory, with the relatively Pyrrhic victory at Skalitz demonstrating that parity was not solely a consequence of superior small arms firepower, for example.  For the Taiping Rebellion you won't be in too much luck with regards to nitty-gritty tactical detail, but there is some. Sections of Stephen R. Platt's *Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom*, particularly the Siege of Anqing, will be notable, whilst Jian Youwen's *The Taiping Revolutionary Movement* contains much on campaigning. Probably the main work with a major tactical element may be Richard J.

418	This gets complicated - on older ships, while the turrets were not gyrostabilised, the sights in the centralised fire-control directors were. The guns were fired from these positions, and, with gyrostabilisation, could only be fired when the roll was appropriate. RPC was helpful for keeping guns on target when the ship was manoeuvring, but less important for a stationary or slow-moving ship that was suffering from roll. 	human
419	"Unfortunately I don't know too much about Fencing schools so I can only really add a bit on the military side of things. Longer swords were not completely unknown to early modern battlefields. Aside from the famous ""greatswords"" the Swiss in particular seem to have often preferred wearing [two-handed longswords](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kba/0016-3/6r) to use in close combat in case their weapon broke. We also know that the rapier itself was used in warfare at least enough for individuals like John Smythe to start complaining about it. Towards the end of the 16th century there seems to have been a general consensus among military writers that for military uses soldiers should stick to carrying a ""short sword"", a 3-foot long,one-handed cut-and-thrust weapon similar to the medieval arming sword, since it got in the way less often and was easier to draw quickly or use in confined spaces when needed. Robert Barret writing in 1598 claimed that during a push of pike the men involved could often become pressed so closely together that even a short sword would not have room to swing or thrust, hence every soldier needed a good short dagger as well. Smythe seems to have agreed on this point, though he thought that harquebusiers and musketeers, who usually fought in a skirmishes, might be fine with just a sword and no dagger.  Writing in the second half of the 17th century, Sir James Turner mentions that once again   &gt;In the time of the late Troubles in England [The English Civil Wars] long Rapier were used for a while, and then laid aside.  Adding to the confusion over how often the rapier was used as a battlefield weapon, over time there does seem to have been quite a bit of blending of design elements between the rapier and the short sword. As a result a great military swords do start to incorporate [complex hilts and relatively narrow blades](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Jacob_de_Gheyn_-_Wapenhandelinge_4.jpg/549px-Jacob_de_Gheyn_-_Wapenhandelinge_4.jpg) and are often interpreted as rapiers, especially by modern translators, but nevertheless are only 3 feet long or less and still intended to be cut-and-thrust weapons to some degree. William Garrard, writing around 1590, recommended that infantry be armed with ""short rapiers"", again stressing that they be short enough to be easily drawn in close quarters:  &gt;Both the Hargabusier and Pykeman must weare a short Rapier and a small Poinado: For if in the middest of Encounters and Skirmishes, they be driuen to vse them, their length is an occasion they cannot be drawen, vnlesse hee a∣bandon his Peece or Pike, whereby hee shall either loose his Pike, or want his Rapier, which at the Sera and Close is verie necessarie both for Defence and Offence:  Elsewhere though, he just uses the term ""sword"".  George Silver is probably best known of the rapier's detractors. Much of his argument involves rejecting the idea that the thrust is any faster or any more deadly than the cut and that it is best to have a weapon which can do both. He also argues that the short sword is more useful as an actual self defense weapon since it is easier to draw and can defend against strong blows more effectively. The ""Perfect length"" for a short sword he defines with [this illustration](http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/pics/paradox_stance.gif), explaining that when holding the sword in this manner the blade should be short enough that it doesn't reach the dagger in the left hand so that a fencer may easily uncross his weapon after parrying. If two skilled rapier fencers cross their weapons with each other, he claims, then the blade will be too long to uncross and bring back on point, and after this the fight would have to be decided by who is the better wrestler or who is the quickest with their dagger.  Curiously though, the length Silver gives for his ""short sword"" is actually a bit longer than what was usually recommended for military short swords at the time. Silver recommends ""The blade to be a yard and an inch for men of mean stature [37 inches], and for men of tall statures, a yard and three or four inches [39-40 inches], and no more."" Most military writers suggest that an military sword should be only a yard long, or in John Smythe's case ""the length of three quarters of a yard, or a yard at the most.""  Silver also states that his short sword should have a closed hilt that wraps around to the pommel, while claiming that the rapier and the military short sword are both made with open cross guards and no hilts, so they don't protect the hand as well. He gives the reasons his opponents state for not liking the closed hilt:  &gt;[Says the false Italian Teacher] "". . . because the cross hinders not to hold the handle in the hand, to thrust both far &amp; straight, &amp; to use all manner of advantages in the wards, or suddenly to call the same at the adversary, but with the sword you are driven with all the strength of the hand to hold fast the handle. And in the wars I would wish no friend of mine to wear swords with hilts, because when they are suddenly set upon, for haste they set their hands upon their hilts instead of their handles, in which time it happens many times before they can draw their swords, they are slain by their enemies.""  In the section where George Silver complains that the rapier is too flimsy and two long to be an effective anti-armor weapon, he also takes the time to make a dig at the military short sword in one of his margin notes:  &gt;To this it will be objected, that in the wars we use few rapiers, or none at all, but short swords. To that I answer: Those are insufficient also, for that they have no hilts, whereby they are insufficient in their defence, and especially for the hand, which being struck although with a very small blow, most commonly is the loss of a man, because the force of his hand being taken from him, he is neither able to defend his life, nor greatly to offend his enemy. And again, since the rapier-fight has been taught, for lack of practice they have lost the use of the blow.  This was apparently less of a problem back when soldiers still carried large shields, gauntlets, or mail gloves.   ---  Anyways, as for other kinds of swords used by men-at-arms in the 16th century. Many authors mention that aside from their lance, men at arms should carry both an arming sword and their mace at their saddle, to use in close combat against heavily armored enemies. John Smythe in *Certain Instructions* greatly expands on these options:  &gt;their wea∣pons ought to be arming swords, and daggers, worne in good and strong girdles, long, and strong launces, with a curtilace [[cutlass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BatailleDreux1562.jpg)] of the one side of the saddle pommell, or a steele mace, or a man at armes axe on the other side as aforsaid. Howbeit I haue seene some both men at armes, and dimi∣launces vse tocks [estocs?] very conueniently worne after the Hon∣garian &amp; Turkie manner vnder their thighs; which Tocks are long narrow stiffe swords onlie for the thrust:  Some time in the second half 16th century most lancers were started to prefer carrying only a lance, sword, and wheelock pistol as a close-quarters anti-armor weapon. Smythe of course didn't like this trend."	human

422	"Brief background: In 1848, a number of revolutions swept European countries (including Hungary); many of these political upheavals were aimed at removing monarchical systems and forming democratic or otherwise more liberal governments.(1)    In Hungary, revolutionaries attempted to gain independence from the Austrian Empire.  Ultimately, with assistance from Russian (then ruled by Tsar Nicholas I), the Austrian emperor put down the revolution and restored imperial power.  From 1849-50, a wave of Hungarian emigrants entered the United States; many of these were former revolutionaries facing backlash in Hungary.  Frederick Douglass delivered his speech, ""What to a slave is the fourth of July?"", in 1852: exactly the time when a famous Hungarian revolutionary was giving a speaking tour throughout the country.  Lajos Kossoth was briefly the president of the independent Kingdom of Hungary in 1848.  As an emigre in the US, he was hailed as a champion of liberty and freedom fighter.  Meanwhile, Douglass said:  &gt; ""...in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse!""  When Douglass said that his listeners (white Americans) were so willing to ""shed tears over fallen Hungary,"" he was talking about the outpouring of pro-Hungary sentiment in the media of his day.  **Douglass was pointing out the hypocrisy of criticizing oppression in Europe while millions of people (African American slaves) were oppressed in their own country, the United States.**   (1) Mike Rapport, *1848: Year of Revolutions* (2010)"	human

He goes into the mindset of the soldiers on both sides, reading letters from soldiers and family. He is a self described fan of history not a historian, so he doesn't take sides. Rather, he gives both or more sides of a controversy without slant.   I know that many hours sounds like a lot but he paints a hell of a picture with his enthusiasm for his topics.	human

432	"A lot of this discussion hinges on the phrase ""within the Empire"". What does it mean to have a title within the Empire? And how was this not the case for the Wettins?  Was there some legal restriction the Hohenzollerns needed to bypass that did not apply to the Wettins?  The title King in Prussia refers to a region outside of the Empire. The Hohenzollern Elector Frederick III was still an Elector of Brandenburg, which was part of the Empire, in addition to being King in Prussia. Similarly, Augustus II was still an Elector of Saxony in addition to being King of Poland. It makes sense for the Emperor to control titles reflective of lands within the Empire, but outside the Empire is beyond his bailiwick.  One explanation I can come up to this is that the HRE already recognized the _title_ King of Poland, and thus by default accepted anyone that came by that title.  But since King of Prussia did not exist as a title, it was the Emperor's prerogative to not recognize the holder of that title (and with good reason as the Hohenzollerns did not control Royal Prussia).  The distinction is subtle, but a hypothetical situation is that some small new kingdom is created just outside the Empire, and the Emperor decides not to recognize the ruler as worthy of the rank of King. That hypothetical king, so long as he does not fear invasion or sanction, need not care as he is not subject to the Emperor's jurisdiction. But the Elector of Brandenburg, by way of contrast, was still subject to the Emperor, who could (in theory) make his life difficult.  Another alternative is that in order to justify himself worthy of a royal title, the Electorate of Brandenburg had to be included in Frederick III's CV as evidence of power, as without it the Hohenzollerns did not have sufficient land/wealth for the title. But since he was not completely sovereign (de jure) over the Electorate (Margraviate) of Brandenburg, it could only be considered part of his CV if the Emperor assented.  From a practical perspective, if one is creating a new title whole cloth then it certainly helps to have some friends legitimate that.  Generally, that involves someone of higher rank."	human

435	"It depends. Because the basic idea was that the underwear absorbed all of the oils and other skin-excretions, cleaning the body and keeping the clothing clean, the outer clothing only had to be washed or spot-cleaned when it was visibly dirty. As such, 17th and 18th century instructions on laundry are largely concerned with linen-washing - see the 1677 (but reprinted many times over the next century) *Compleat Servant-Maid*, which instructs ""such who intend to be Laundry-Maids in Great Houses"" to concern themselves with perfectly cleaning and mending linen.  The 19th century saw many more sets of laundry instructions printed in books and magazines, with very detailed steps. We can see why the inner/outer clothing layer system became so necessary from the recipe in an 1873 issue of *Godey's Lady's Book* for cleaning black silk ""with very little trouble and expense"":  &gt;Take entirely to pieces the dress, jacket, etc. and well shake each piece; then spread over a deal table a newspaper or sheet of clean paper, and on it lay a breadth of the silk. Brush it well both sides with a fine soft brush - a hat brush would very well answer the purpose. Shake it again; fold together in half and place it on one side of the table. In the same manner, shake, brush, and shake again each piece of the silk. Remove the paper and place on the table a clean newspaper, or sheet of paper. Newspapers answer best: they are large and smooth and probably at hand. On the paper, again place a breadth of the silk and into a clean quart basin pour a half-pint of cold water, adding half a pint of good sweetened gin, which is better for the purpose than unsweetened, as the sugar stiffens the silk. These are the proportions for any quantity required. Have ready a piece of black crape or black merino about half a yard square: dip it well into the liquid and thoroughly wash over the best side of the silk. Be careful that it is well cleaned, and, if possible, wash it from edge to edge and wet it well all over. Then fold over the silk in half; then again, till the folds are the width of those of new silk. Place it in a clean towel and clean each piece of the silk in the same manner, laying one piece on the other; and remembering by a mark which is the last piece done, as that must be the last ironed. Let the silk lie folded in the towel until a large iron is well heated, but be careful that it is not too hot; try it first on paper or a piece of old damped silk. Use two irons. Open the towel when the iron is ready, and place the piece of silk that was first cleaned on an old table cloth or sheet, folded thick; iron the wrong side quickly from edge to edge until dry. Fold the silk over lightly to the width of new silk, and place it on one end of the table until all is done. This simple process stiffens, cleans, and makes the silk look new.  (This is followed by a similar process for black wool.)  That is not something you're going to go through (followed by completely remaking the garment) unless you really need to deeply clean and refresh something. However, not all clothing was this fine.  Instructions relating to washing entire dresses starts to appear around 1850. *Miss Leslie's Lady's New Receipt-book* taught women to wash dresses of colored fabrics carefully to prevent the dyes from running - keeping the water from being too hot, mixing in fixatives, wringing the dresses out immediately. It explained which hooks and eyes could be used on dresses to be washed, and how to fix ones that were flattened when sent out to be washed (likely from being put through a mangle). I'm not fully sure when this began to be called a ""wash dress"", but certainly by the last quarter of the century. Since a wash dress could have trims and fancy buttons that would have to be removed and sewn back on every time it was laundered, some would likely be cleaned less frequently than others."	human
436	Most likely because it had recently been ravaged by both a near-simultaneous rebellion in it's stolen African lands, as well as a Fascist coup by Francisco Franco and an ensuing 'civil' war and anarchist/Communist revolution.

440	Aircraft carrier doctrine was not formulated as a result of real-life battle experience. Rather, it was developed through exercises and wargames, as well as theoretical considerations.  The Royal Navy's first peacetime exercise involving an aircraft carrier came in September 1919. Eleven aircraft from 185 Squadron, flying off HMS Argus, made an attack on the 2nd Battle Squadron while it was moored in Portland Harbour on the 6th. This attack was intended more as a demonstration of the new capability, so was made in broad daylight. To compensate, three aircraft were equipped with smoke bombs, and the attack divided into two groups, each approaching from a different direction. Eight dummy torpedoes were dropped, with a total of six hits scored (the other two dived into the seabed). This exercise clearly demonstrated the use of carriers against a battlefleet in port. Such early exercises also helped develop concepts such as concentrated strikes, as well as the basics of carrier operations, such as the use of arrester wires and landing signals   In the 1920s and 1930s, the Royal Navy carried out a series of exercises, mainly focused on a war with Japan. These generally had two components; a strategic game, carried out on paper, and a tactical game, carried out either with models, or with actual ships. The strategic game attempted to replicate a situation with which the RN felt it might be faced, and was used to set up the condition for the tactical game. One key conclusion from the early exercises was that carriers could not operate entirely with the battlefleet; the carrier's constant need to turn into the wind to launch and recover aircraft would result in the two forces separating.  An example exercise in which aircraft carriers were involved was Exercise MU. This exercise, carried out in August 1925 by the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets in the Aegean Sea, attempted to replicate the conditions a British force might face when attempting to reinforce Singapore. The fleets were divided into a Red, British, force, and a Blue, Japanese, force, with Blue receiving the one aircraft carrier available. Red had to traverse a narrow, mined channel, representing the Malacca Strait, while Blue had to stop them. Blue's plan included an attack on the fleet by carrier aircraft, which was successfully carried out with hits on three Red battleships. It was concluded from this that torpedo aircraft were a significant threat, with it being recommended that a strong CAP be maintained as a protection.  Exercise MU was followed, in 1928, by MU2, which again attempted to represent a reinforcement of Singapore, using an island off the coast of Algeria as a stand-in. This time, both Blue and Red had a carrier, which both used to great effect. A later exercise, in July, pitted two carriers from the Mediterranean Fleet, *Courageous* and *Eagle*, against each other. Aircraft from *Courageous* successfully located *Eagle* while the latter was in the process of ranging her strike. *Eagle* was soon judged to have been destroyed. This helped establish a key rule of RN carrier doctrine; that the first carrier to launch would be the likely survivor of the engagement. As such, future British doctrine emphasised rapidly launching strikes, and launching strikes in conditions such as night or poor weather, to ensure that the RN launched first.  1929 saw a number of innovations in carrier operations. On the 23rd March 1929, during Exercise MI, three carriers, *Courageous, Furious* and *Glorious*, formed a single squadron. This exercise was used to test a number of theories about how carriers should operate in groups. In the exercise, each of the three carriers was dedicated to a single role; one carried only fighters, one carried only reconnaissance aircraft, and one attack aircraft. This was soon found to be flawed, as the loss of one carrier would deny that capability to the fleet. It was concluded that a mixed airgroup would be superior. A further exercise showed that escorted carriers could form an effective strike force. This exercise also showed that torpedo aircraft were much more effective than level bombers. In 1931, Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson was appointed as Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers. He continued to exercise the three carriers together, refining their tactics and developing new techniques. These exercise helped mould the RN carrier force into what it was at the start of WWII.  The Royal Navy, which, for much of the 1920s and 1930s, did not have control of its own aircraft, and so took a number of doctrinal lessons from the RAF. One such doctrinal lesson was the idea that 'the bomber will always get through' - that fighters could not catch bombers before they could make their attack. This partly resulted from the relative performance of bombers and fighters in this period - multi-engined monoplane bombers were much faster than the typical biplane fighters in operation, while without radar direction, it was unlikely that defending fighters could find attacking bombers, especially over sea. Equally, it was influenced by the theories of writers such as Douhet, who emphasised the strategic capability of bombers, and neglected fighters. Douhet's ideas were held by many in the RAF, and so were passed on to the RN. This led to the RN de-emphasising fighter defence in the design of the *Illustrious*-class carriers. Instead, the focus was on armour and on anti-aircraft guns. 	human

443	"The Oppenheimer of ""Manhattan"" should not be confused with the historical Oppenheimer. They have similarities but the Oppenheimer of ""Manhattan,"" like the rest of the show, is definitely meant to be in some kind of alternate universe from our own. In general he reflects the chillier, angrier side of Oppenheimer's personality — one that did in fact exist, and is often downplayed in his more traditional depiction as a scientific martyr — but he also had more charming, warm sides as well.  Oppenheimer was remarkably good at charming people who he wanted to charm, and that included military people and Washington people (most of the time — he could commit faux pas, and sometimes did). He was not extremely involved in the day to day science of the project, at least not after he became Scientific Director (he did some work for the project prior to this). His real contribution to the project was coordination and serving as a liaison to the scientists, the ""good cop"" to Groves' ""bad cop.""  I am fond of the portrayal of Oppenheimer in ""Manhattan,"" both because the actor captures his alien weirdness very well, but also because he is such a strong contrast with, say, the ""feel good"" Oppenheimer of the film _Fat Man and Little Boy._ The real-life Oppenheimer could be cutting and nasty and had affairs with Communists and many other things that ""Manhattan"" took pains to depict.  On Oppenheimer's life, the best biography currently is Bird and Sherwin's _American Prometheus_.

444	We design CAS aircraft with Guided AT missiles or specially made Gatling guns to destroy tanks. During WW2 there were no armor piercing bombs or missiles that were accurate and powerful enough to destroy tanks. They could strike against supporting units like infantry and lighter vehicles, But actually knocking out a tank was almost impossible without using specialized AT weapons. And those weapons were very underwhelming in terms of accuracy and firepower if they could even penetrate a tank's armor. Eg the 3.7cm guns on certain Ju-87 variants had 12 rounds per gun and needed to close within 500m to be able to penetrate the top of most tank's armor. Which would make it really hard to score a hit since you have so few projectiles to send their way, And your aiming system is fairly innacurate. Otherwise things like rockets and bombs didn't use any sort of AT warheads so they wouldn't be very practical for the role.	human
445	"""Bathing"" as in full submersion in a tub was not terribly common, since it was so inconvenient to heat or even move that much water (most of us only bath every once in while, we just shower instead). However, washing was common. Think of it like a sponge bath at a hospital- it's still very effective. Numerous etiquette manuals emphasize washing the hands regularly, particularly before meals, as well as the face and personal areas. This was at least a daily occurrence. Most often you'll hear of ""dry baths"", however, which is in reference to the dirt and oils removed by the shift and shirt mentioned by u/chocolatepot above. I've actually tried this method, as have a number of people I know, and it's surprisingly effective.

446	There's a lot of stuff I want to talk about here but unfortunately, it's either FOUO or plain not for a public forum. So I'll try to delve into it:  &gt; We design CAS aircraft with Guided AT missiles or specially made Gatling guns to destroy tanks.  I assume you're talking about the 30mm GAU-8 on the A-10 - its effectiveness at destroying tanks is questionable, certainly for modern armor.  The 20mm that most US aircraft carry today fires the PGU-28 SAPHEI round. SAPHEI standing for Semi-Armor Piercing, High Explosive, Incendiary. [General Dynamics page here](https://www.gd-ots.com/munitions/medium-caliber-ammunition/20mm-x-102-pgu/).  So even our rounds aren't used to destroy tanks anymore.  And during Desert Storm, most bombs dropped - of which a lot were dropped on Iraqi troop formations - were not of the guided kind. Over [90% of bombs dropped](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/operation-desert-storm-was-not-won-smart-weaponry-alone-180957879/) were unguided.  The other part is that knocking out a tank comes in many flavors. A bomb that hits nearby a tank can knock its treads off, immobilizing it and potentially knocking it out of a fight. Armor on top of tanks is notably lower than elsewhere, so even lighter weapons were more effective if fired from above.   And I think you're overestimating the amount of armor on a lot of tanks in WW2 - light tanks were common during the war and most certainly could be knocked out by those weapons you've listed.  And air power is psychological in a lot of ways too - it's not that a single bomb could destroy vehicle. It's the fact that you can't fight back that can send an entire armored column scattering, much like today insurgents are quickly silenced when air support is called in.	human
447	"Rubbish.  ^ this one doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. Could not have possibly read a single Hancock book.  Graham Hancock's books are riddle with groundbreaking scientific research. All his books, save *Talisman* and *The Mars Mystery*, have a massive bibliography of peer reviewed articles submitted to world class journals. His latest, *Magicians of the Gods*, commits a significant amount of time presenting the possible comet impact around 12,800-12,900 BP that may have played a pivotal roll in the abrupt end to the Younger Dryas. (I say 'possible' and 'may' to present it neutrally, but at this point it's obvious)  Hancock is a journalist. His occupation is investigation and presentation. He never claims to be any more than that. That being said his grasp on complex scientific concepts and their roll in human history is vividly clear. Because he breaks down these concepts so anyone with a highschool reading level can easily understand.   He's been attacked over and over for researching something that ought to be fascinating to anyone, and the malicious intent of some of his critics is apparent in their refusal to debate, instead use ad hominem attacks to discredit him on an idea that's as old as civilization. Even the oldest legible human texts talk about forgotten civilizations. In fact most ancient civilizations have some form of a forgotten civilization in their culture. That continued in Greece, continued in Europe after the church lost its iron grip, and still happening to this day.  He argues that one or more civilizations existed before the great deluge. The greatest obstacle for his argument is proving that there in fact was a deluge - a cataclysmic flood - some 13,000 years ago that wiped out most of the evidence of those civilizations. You only have to read the first 150 pages of *Magicians of the Gods* to be convinced on this. (His previous books *Underworld* and *Fingerprints* approach this issue but fall short. Oddly enough for someone ""entirely ignorant"" he's quiet humble about the scientific gems he had to uncover and reconcile to get to *Magicians*)  Ask me anything about Graham's books and research and I will unload all the evidence he's gathered in the last 20+ years and I'll even give a basic chronology of how the scientific debate has evolved to favor Hancock's view.  Gobekli Tepe, my dude!? Gobekli-fucking-Tepe!?! That shit's 11,000-12,000 years old! AND it's huge! AND IT WAS BURIED ON PURPOSE AS IF THEY PREDICTED THE END OF THEIR WORLD BY COMET!!

448	I don’t have sources in front of me, so I’m pulling this from memory from a college project long since passed.   Short Answer: The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) destroyed the Spanish economy and nation to the point that the nation could not substantively contribute to either the Axis or Allied war effort.  Long Answer: They did, kinda...  The Franco regime that solidified power following the SCW closely resembled other nationalist governments such as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Franco received material and military support from those two nations during the SCW and retained diplomatic ties with both following the end of the war. Hitler conducted talks with Franco in the early 1940s in part as a way to plan for eventually control of British Gibraltar.  The Spanish organized expeditionary forces that served with the Nazi’s on the Eastern Front. These “Blue Divisions” supposedly repaid the Dueda de Sangre (Blood Debt) that Spain incurred by receiving German military assistance during the Civil War. These units fought on the Eastern Front, most notably during the Siege of Leningrad.  Diplomatically Spain served as a thorn in the side of the Allies and Axis alike. A sort of quasi economic war erupted between the two factions over Spanish tungsten supplies.

I'm actually surprised only 90% of it was dumb. But obviously bombers are going to have a lot of targets where anti tank weapons aren't ideal. But there's a big difference between having ATGMs for your plane and not having ATGMs like during ww2. And the GAU-8 having questionable AT performance is kinda what i'm saying already. And even then its potential is much better since it's more accurate and dispensing a much greater volume of fire than a WW2 plane. I think you're confusing modern bombing with WW2 era bombing tbh. You've got a well trained dude with 70 years of theory and technology for the job backing him up, Versus a poorly trained dude using a fairly new tactic on a fighter retrofitted for the role a lot of the time. And i already acknowledged that they could do external damage to the tank, hit supporting units etc. And obviously it would effect moral but you simply didn't have armor piercing weaponry on aircraft that was accurate or effective enough to destroy armor reliably.	human

454	It wasn't, really. The retention of the skilled/trained personnel of the BEF meant that the British had a core around which they could built their force for the return to Europe, but it had very little influence on Sea Lion itself, which was a stupid idea (such as it was, the Navy and Army never did agree on a plan) and would never have worked no matter if the BEF survived or not. Bernard over at Military History Visualised goes over the various reasons why Sea Lion was a non-starter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_7Mn9CxKkk   The BEF had approximately 250,000 men returned, the British Army in July 1940 had, on paper, 600,000 infantrymen. Granted, almost half were Home Guard and not up to much. I don't know of any stats which show by job description what numbers of BEF got back, doing a quick review of the Orbat, I count the BEF had about 86 infantry battalions. Each infantry battalion had four rifle companies of 97 men, so assuming they were all up to strength, that's 33,000 of that figure who were infantrymen. So, the British basically had a quarter million somewhat professional, if disorganised, infantry to oppose the landing even if the BEF was left behind. Given that there was bugger-all chance of the Kriegsmarine sustaining a landing in the face of the Royal Navy, it was down to the 25,000 or so airmobile troops the Germans could provide. Even the Home Guard could deal with that.	human
455	"I want to be sure you're referring to dive bombers in particular. They were not commonly used against tanks, the main dive bombers being the A36 Apache for the US and the Ju-87 (Stuka) for the Germans. Neither of which were particularly used against tanks or anything else in the later part of the war. However, given that the typical tank of the early war period had bugger-all armor, it is not inconceivable that Stukas could have been effective against them. In fairness, however, a Stuka/Hs.129 unit is credited with being the first unit to stop, by air power alone, an armoured attack, near Prokohovka, Kursk 1943.  The problem/myth comes when you start looking at allied ground attack aircraft. Unlike the Germans and Russians, the Americans and British didn't really use any purpose-built equipment. The P47s or Typhoons which have their reputation of destroying Panzers were really fighters re-roled for ground attack. As a result, although they made a lot of noise, and the pilots caim back with huge claims of kills against enemy tanks, research conducted on destroyed tanks indicates that their claims of practical effectiveness against tanks was hugely overstated.   That's not to say they didn't have huge psychological effect, or an effect against softer targets than tanks, but the idea of ""Egads, an enemy Panther, let's call in an airstrike"" is a bit misconceived. Of course, if the end result is that the enemy Panzer is no longer a problem (because it's out of gas, abandoned by crew or whatever), nobody on the ground is going to complain about the fact that it wasn't because the P47 actually punched a hole in it.  When it comes to dedicated ground attack aircraft such as the IL-2 or Hs.129, I have no reason to believe that they were not as effective against tanks as they are claimed to have been, but they were not dive bombers."	human
456	Interesting, I just read this in a book on vexillology. As well as your red, green, and yellow, black is also popular in both regions. This will be a shorter abridged version of what is in Tim Marshall's *Worth Dying For: The Power and Politics of Flags* which I highly recommend reading.  In Africa, it stems from the flag of Ethiopia, as it was the only uncolonised African country (Liberia is another matter not for this topic). That flag's coulours stem from the apparent colour of the rainbow after the Great Flood of Genesis. Marcus Garvey, leader of the US organisation UNIA, took inspiration from this to create the UNIA flag that contained red, green, and black, as he misthought the Ethiopian flag had black instead of yellow. Rastafarianism also helped combine the two separate 3 colour schemes together. Many African flags stem from these four 'colours of Africa'.  As for the Middle East, yellow has been replaced by white. The three colours were first brought together as the Arab Revolt flag during the First World War to unify the Arabs against the Ottomans. The white represents the Umayyad dynasty, responsible for expanding the caliphate from Portugal to Samarkand. Green represents the Fatimid dynasty but is also considered to be the colour of Islam as it was the Prophet's favourite colour. Black represents the colour of the Prophet's main banner and the headdress worn by pre-Islamic tribesmen in battle, while red is the colour of Sharif Hussein's tribe, included because he is the one who designed the Arab Revolt flag.  If you want to know what each country says the colours of their flag officially represent, the book has chapters dedicated to both regions.	human

From his book Mein Kampf: ""I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika.          In describing the flag, he also added ""[we see] in the swastika, the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work.""      Around the time of the flags creation, objects with swastikas on them were found near the ancient city of Troy by Heinrich Schliemann, thus associating the swastika with the Aryan race in the minds of many Germans. The symbol was further cemented as such when the flag was unveiled, becoming something Germans could look to as a symbol of their supposed racial superiority and ""pure"" lineage."	human

463	"The short answer is that any type of head protection is better than none. You mention concussion and this was a very important factor that was taken into account. If you take a look at the development of medieval helmets you'll see [earlier on](https://www.medievalarmour.com/images/Category/medium/790.png) that there is a trend of flat helms which did give you good protection around your head but left you very vulnerable to blows from the top. As a result we see helmets starting to become [more angled](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ee/53/30/ee53302911c5e780547a11ae75268f24.jpg) to glance off any incoming blows from the top, this might have been helpful against arrows too similarly to how a breastplate is curved. This is by no means a consistent trend throughout all cultures.  ""Beating your enemy stupid"" is a completely viable tactic. If you look at the weaponry of medieval knights they would often carry blunt weapons suchs as warhammers and maces simply because a sword or spear does not penetrate plate so blunt damage was the most efficient way to take down an armoured opponent. You must also taken into account that swords were never a primary weapon but a side arm. Hollywood does not help in this regard since everyone loves a good sword fight, but historically spears and pikes were always the go to weapons and just using common sense it would be pretty hard to concuss someone with a long weapon designed to thrust. So yeah helmet &gt; no helmet, any blow to the head would be greatly enhanced without protection.  For bonus question: There is plenty of cutting videos on youtube, without any protection it is very easy to cut through an arm. With mail i would say it is very unlikely but maybe a giant could manage it. Remember kids, armour in real life works, that is why they wore it and it's heavy and encumbering for a reason."	human

467	"Textually, we have an incredibly rich trove of accounts of visitors to Rome. On one hand, the collection is perhaps not quite as interesting as we might want: the Venn diagram of ""people who were both literate and whose writings are likely to have survived"" and ""people with an awareness of a basic history of the Roman Empire and its decline"" is basically a a circle, especially from the mid-11th century on. On the other hand, their shared knowledge of and appreciation for ancient Rome offers a good basis for comparison of different perspectives.  Benjamin of Tudela is a good place to start for an important reason: in the face of Rome's role at the heart of medieval Christianity, Benjamin was Jewish! He came from Navarre in Iberia, and his meandering travel account catalogues the Jewish communities he traveled among around the Mediterranean. You can read his full account of Rome and Roman Jews here (Cntl/Cmd+F for ""Rome"" is easiest), but to excerpt a few bits:  &gt; There are many wonderful structures in the city, different from any others in the world. **Including both its inhabited and ruined parts,** Rome is about twenty-four miles in circumference. In the midst thereof there are eighty palaces belonging to eighty kings who lived there, each called Imperator, commencing from King Tarquinius down to Nero and Tiberius, who lived at the time of Jesus the Nazarene, ending with Pepin, who freed the land of Sepharad from Islam, and was father of Charlemagne.  &gt; There is a palace outside Rome (said to be of Titus). The Consul and his 300 Senators treated him with disfavour, because he failed to take Jerusalem till after three years, though they had bidden him to capture it within two.  &gt; In Rome is also the palace of Vespasianus, a great and very strong building; also the Colosseum...There were battles fought here in olden times, and in the palace more than 100,000 men were slain, and there their bones remain piled up to the present day. The king caused to be engraved a representation of the battle and of the forces on either side facing one another, both warriors and horses, all in marble, to exhibit to the world the war of the days of old.  &gt; In Rome there is a cave which runs underground, and catacombs...In the church of St. John in the Lateran there are two bronze columns taken from the Temple, the handiwork of King Solomon, each column being engraved ""Solomon the son of David."" The Jews of Rome told me that every year upon the 9th of Ab they found the columns exuding moisture like water.  Although Benjamin observes that some of Rome is standing/inhabited and some is ruins, he does not distinguish which is which in his description (nor does that distinction allow for, as we will see, inhabited ruins). However, he is keenly aware of the history of the ancient Roman buildings and those who lived in them. Those stories--what Rome *was*--matter more than what they *are*. He takes note of great buildings, natural features, and smaller monuments. I also think the detail about the columns of the Temple seized and appropriated into a Christian church are fascinating and significant. Especially in recounting the miracle story of the local Jewish community, Benjamin shows that Rome could have a sacred geography for *non*-Christians--something I, at least, am not used to thinking of.  Notably absent from Benjamin's record, on the other hand, is commentary on the *fall* of Rome. For this, believe it or not, we have to turn to Christian writers. In their stylings, a very real admiration for classical antiquity aligns with the medieval Christian theology of history that saw a ""world grown old,"" decaying towards apocalypse and only ever renewable by God. 11th-12th century cleric Hildebert of Lavardin, eventually archbishop of Tours, wrote two famous poems *de Roma* which both celebrate and mourn the ancient city as he found it at the very end of the 11th century:  &gt; The city now is fallen; I can find  &gt; No worthier epitaph than “this was Rome.”  &gt; Yet neither the flight of years, nor flame nor sword  &gt; Could fully wipe away its loveliness  &gt; […] Bring wealth, new marble, and the help of gods  &gt; Let craftsmen’s hands be active in their work—  &gt; Yet shall these standing walls no equal find,  &gt; Nor can these ruins even be restored  &gt; The care of men once built so great a Rome  &gt; The care of gods could not dissolve its stones  &gt; Divinities admire their faces carved,  &gt; And wish themselves the equal of these forms  &gt; Nature could not make gods as fair of face  &gt; As man created images of gods  With Hildebert, praises of Rome move into a more emotional register, but also a more intellectual one rather than practical/geographical. His words are grounded in ancient Rome's buildings and especially its art but he evokes the splendor of a lost civilization rather than the immediate materiality of buildings rooted in history. It's also significant that Hildebert's praise, while overtly of the artistic qualities of ancient Roman art, is actually directed at the *human artists*. He elevates the abilities of humans of old especially compared to present ones, whose skills and vision could never possibly measure up.  A few years later, the English traveler known as Master Gregory famously followed Hildebert's footsteps to Rome. Gregory actually knew one of Hildebert's poems--he quotes it in his own little travel guide-like account!--but takes his commentary a step further.  &gt; The sight of the whole city is, I think, most wonderful, where there is such a multitude of towers, so great a number of palaces, as none can count. When I first saw the city from far off, I was overwhelmed and remembered Caesar's view of it, when having conquered the Gauls and crossed the Alps, he exclaimed *substantial quote from Caesar*...  &gt; This beauty passing understanding I long admired, and I thanked God who...yet has magnified there the works of man with immeasurable beauty. For even if Rome falls into complete ruin, nothing that is intact can be compared with it. As has been said [by Hildebert, in fact]:  &gt; *Nothing can equal Rome, Rome even in ruins*  &gt; *Your ruins speak aloud your former greatness*  &gt; **The ruin of Rome shows clearly, I think, that all temporal things are near their end, especially when the worldly center of all things, Rome, daily languishes and decays.**  Rome as the ""worldly"" center of the word is one of those little noteworthy turns of phrase. In medieval Christian *sacred* geography, the center of the world was Jerusalem. Here, though, Gregory focuses on the human component in Christian world/salvation history--and he is even more explicit than Hildebert about the decline of the present from earlier greatness.  We're used to a ""decline and fall of Rome"" narrative as Christians supposedly ruining the great rationality/progress/technology of pagan/philosophical Rome. Medieval Christians actually took part in the view of a Roman golden age compared to their own; for them, however, the rise of Christianity was less a *cause* of decline than an inevitable step towards ultimate divine redemption.  Gregory relates one more detail I want to highlight here: he tells us that many of the statues from the days of pagan Roman glory were dismantled by (very important) Pope Gregory I! We can agree on one hand it's quite noteable that he's repeating a story about Christians actively opposing the preservation of pagan art, and not very approvingly. On the other, this Gregory projects the 'desecration' onto another Gregory several centuries in the past.  In fact, the appropriation and remixing of ancient Rome into a Christian city was *ongoing* throughout the Middle Ages. Even in the later 15th century, with ""Renaissance"" adulation of classical antiquity building to a fever pitch, prelates in Rome were still plunder the Colosseum and deserted palaces for stones for their own lavish building projects!  This brings us to the last thing I want to talk about: archaeological evidence for ""what people thought"" of Roman ruins, evidence that perhaps helps us get beyond the view of the absolute elite of the elite of high medieval society. The Colosseum is the famous example here, since it enjoyed many afterlives throughout the Middle Ages. Most famously, it eventually became a little neighborhood for artisans! Quarrymen and blacksmiths set up residence, even building the occasional shop for horseshoes and other goods. Eventually, a monastery was constructed in and around part of it. And all the while, tantalizing blocks of stone were usurped for building projects elsewhere.  Visitors to Rome saw ""ruins"" and ""desertion,"" and the ashes of of past splendor. People who lived in Rome may well have seen that, too. But they also saw promise for the present and the future: what could be out of what had been."	human

As this is AskHistorians and not DebateHistorians, if you have any specific claims from Hancock that you find particularly strong, it'd be much better to submit a new question regarding it (Gobleki Tepe would be a good place to start.) I'll admit that I have not read the entirety of *Magicians*; most of my knowledge comes from [Hancock's lecture and podcast appearances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5LCLljJho); if that is not an accurate representation of ideas on the Younger Dryas Impact Theory (YDIT), let me know. However, I will address some concerns here, mostly dealing with the YDIT.  &gt; groundbreaking scientific research  Why do I not buy this? *Magicians* was released in **2015.** The research first suggesting a comet impact was published in **2007**.

The pro- and con- arguments are nicely summed up [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GfSYjKOxZb6Bjiielk4g0t2AYPXig9x-/view?usp=sharing). This is why when you claim he's ""uncovering scientific gems"" I might look at you weird- these are ideas that have been proposed critiqued, adjusted, and reconciled before Hancock even knew about them.  &gt; a massive bibliography of peer reviewed articles submitted to world class journals.  It seems we have different definitions of massive. I'm looking at the bibliography to *[Fingerprints](http://www.megpugh.com/files/Graham_Hancock_FINGERPRINTS_OF_THE_GODS.pdf)* right now. It totals 6 pages. The books of comparable length on my desk have 25 and 42 pages of citations each. This 20-page [review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GfSYjKOxZb6Bjiielk4g0t2AYPXig9x-/view?usp=sharing) of literature on the Younger Dryas event has more citations than the entirety of *Fingerprints.* Looking through *Magicians* [isn't any better.](https://books.google.com/books?id=8iLVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA500&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=Magicians+of+the+Gods+pdf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tuS94UtMsV&amp;sig=IVSD8weZqTU1SjBktSmxusV5kgI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHkqSgg4nZAhUwtlkKHWYfBUE4ChDoAQhYMAk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) There's lots of strings of ""ibid"" meaning he's just copying/summarizing another work at length, occasionally some books from the past 20 years, *a lot* of news articles, lots of websites with no description, rarely ever multiple sources about the same topic, plenty of ""see Graham Hancock..."", [www.gosouthamerica.about.com](https://www.tripsavvy.com/central-and-south-america-4139127)...  the journal articles that deal with any topic but the YDIT are a fraction of a percentage of the notes.  But that's only so important. You'll notice that the articles I've linked here all cite the people they disagree with. Hancock rarely does that. The only thing more telling about a book's quality than its bibliography is what it doesn't have. For instance, in *Fingerprints*, Hancock cites just one book on Tiwanaku from 1945, yet spends most of a chapter on it. There are 50 years of research in between. Alan Kolata's comprehensive, accessible *Tiwanaku: A Portrait of a Civilization* was published a few years earlier, so it's not like the research was hard to find. Why does he not reference it? Why does he not cite it? This is why people seem so dismissive of his work, especially if they are the ones doing those 50 years of research. If you're telling me to change, you need to intentionally provide new evidence that contradicts my model- show me where Hancock provides specific claims about the Americas by mainstream archaeologists and tries to prove them wrong, and then we can talk.

470	&gt;If you take a look at the development of medieval helmets you'll see earlier on that there is a trend of flat helms which did give you good protection around your head but left you very vulnerable to blows from the top. As a result we see helmets starting to become more angled to glance off any incoming blows from the top, this might have been helpful against arrows too similarly to how a breastplate is curved.  It's not even consistent within the medieval period. Nasal helmets projecting upwards to a peaked or rounded top seem to have been by far the most popular from the 9th century or so up until the close of the 12th. The [St. Wenceslaus helmet](http://www.bohemican.com/uploads/5/8/3/3/5833893/5622689.jpg?1420979924) is one of the better surviving originals. Square-topped great helmets similar to the one you linked came into use in the mid-13th century, probably for better protection from lances either at tournament or during the initial cavalry clash; they were often worn in conjunction with smaller iron caps, so that the great helmet could be removed when it came time for swordplay.	human
471	So, just under a year ago, [news broke](http://www.vikingfregerslev.dk/nyheder-7?PID=7022&amp;M=NewsV2&amp;Action=1&amp;NewsId=937) that a bundle of arrowheads had been discovered during the excavation of an incredibly high status 'Rider's Grave' (Viking age grave including fittings for horse equipment) in Denmark. A few days later, the initial CT-scan showed that not only was this now the *second largest* single grouping of arrowheads found in a burial at 22-23 heads, but that part of the organic quiver had been preserved by the way the arrowheads corroded.  Now on [*Tuesday*](http://www.vikingfregerslev.dk/nyheder-7?PID=7022&amp;M=NewsV2&amp;Action=1&amp;NewsId=1049) the first results of the conservation were released -- part of the quiver has indeed survived, and appears to be a cylinder made of two pieces of softwood covered in leather. Not only that, but the arrowshafts have been bound in *silver wire* (the wire isn't visible, so could conceivably also be copper/brass in line with the Hedeby find) and the buckle associated to it was made of copper and silver, making this an imminently fancy bit of gear.  The amazing bit is the quiver though -- we're fairly certain a large number of the multiple-arrowhead finds in graves were originally deposited in quivers, or else tied together, because of how they're found bundled together. However, soil conditions almost always destroy the all-organic quivers, and this is only the *second* time (yes the *second time*) the very exact conditions needed to preserve at least some of the organics have happened to coincide with a deposited Western style quiver (the other was Scar in Scotland, and yes I've qualified that with 'Western style' because we do have two or three well preserved *Eastern* style quivers from Birka and Moscheva Balka and Altdorf and probably other places, not to mention the slightly more numerous finds of metal fittings from Eastern quivers).   It's also only the *third* find of a Western Viking quiver *at all* (Hedeby produced parts of at least one probable quiver from the harbour).  And unlike Scar, which only had bare traces of wood on the outside of the arrows, there's more than enough surviving of the woodwork to get a reasonable idea of the construction. Pictures are currently minimal, but I'm holding out hope for a decent amount of the base to be preserved... it's still not going to answer my question of how to strap one of these non-Hedeby style quivers, but it's still more answers than we had!  And the wire wrapping is just as rare -- being again, only the third find ever, with parallels from Hedeby and Birka.  So yeah, this is *rare*, probably even *rarer than rare* and is very, very exciting and I can't wait for the full publication.  (Also, if you're wondering what the largest single deposition of arrowheads in a burial is, it was the Ladby ship at 45!)	human
472	You are correct in referring to nasal helmets since they were a common choice in the early medieval period.

473	The cold war is the basic answer  The longer more complex answer is that Russia had a very firm grip on the population at the time. There was propaganda everywhere as well as secret police watching everyone at all times. The Soviet Union was basically a totalitarian dictatorship to the people of east Germany, thus they were given very little room for self expression that wasn't nationalist.

474	I’ll speak to the open and transitionary phase of warfare on the Western Front in 1914. I could discuss 1918 as well, but this answer will be long enough. Needless to say, a comparative approach like that would be interesting, but I simply don’t have the time to tackle it.  If you’re interested in 1918, I recommend looking at the Battle of Amiens. There, we have a British Army employing advanced combined arms tactics to good effect, the result of four years of learning and grinding in the West.   The first couple months were very different.   In terms of structure, I think I’ll briefly look at how these armies expected and planned to fight in 1914. Then I’ll look at the following engagements: the early fighting in Alsace, the Ardennes, the Battle of the Marne, and finally the Race to the Sea and the quickly the First Battle of Ypres.   At the end, I’ll identify four common themes I think answer your question most directly. I’ll highlight them as I go through my examination of my chosen engagements.   I’ve relied heavily on Holger Herwig’s *The Marne,* which I highly recommend if you’re interested in the open phase of the war.   **Prewar Tactics**  I see lots of readers, particularly on this subreddit, who believe that armies went to war in 1914 with “Napoleonic” tactics. That’s an oversimplification. While it’s true that armies didn’t have effective combined arms systems like they did in 1914, tactics attempted to make the best of improved firepower in the form of quick-firing artillery, magazine-fed rifles, and water-cooled machine guns.   All armies in the West believed that the offensive was key to victory. To pass the initiative to the enemy was certain to result in defeat. Striking quickly and boldly thus formed the backbone of tactical systems before the war.   In regards artillery, the French army and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the British army favored close infantry support. Their pieces were mostly field guns designed to be wheeled into battle and fire on targets directly. They had few howitzers that could be dug in safely behind the firing line. The Germans, because they had to reduce the fortress complexes in France and Belgium, had heavier guns and more howitzers, but indirect firing remained in its infancy in 1914.   Infantry tactics generally emphasized a decisive attack, often with the bayonet. In essence, you’d engage the enemy in a firefight, attempt to draw in his reserves, and then launch a general counterattack at a flank or weak point in the line. The final bayonet charge was meant to break the enemy’s morale, instigating a retreat. As will become apparent from below, such a neat system rarely played out in practice, due largely to poor communications.   I’ve oversimplified somewhat here for economy’s sake, but it’s important to note that nobody assumed that this type of fighting would be bloodless. All armies recognized that deadly nature of new weapons and expected heavy losses.  Finally, I’d like to emphasize that all sides were prepared to dig. The British Army, for example, had clear plans for deploying entrenchments in conjunction with the system of fighting I’ve described above. So did the Germans, and so did the French. Trenches, though, were a means to an end. Field fortifications were meant to strengthen the line so that armies could bolster their reserves, thereby giving more weight to their counterattacking forces. As soon as armies started colliding in 1914, they took to the spade.    **Alsace-Lorraine**  For this section, I’ll take a look at the fighting in and around Mulhouse in Alsace. As part of its war plan (Plan XVII), the French pushed into Alsace-Lorraine. The plan was to “fix” the German left wing, but there was an obviously nationalistic agenda in the plan.  On August 7, French VII Corps under Bonneau (who was Alsatian-born) advanced toward Altkirch and pushed out the small German garrison at the point of the bayonet. He took Mulhouse without opposition the next day. The Germans moved against Mulhouse on August 9, but the attack quickly degenerated into disorderly frontal assaults. The area was heavily wooded and had many vineyards, so the fighting was in close quarters.  Casualties were heavy. According to Herwig, at Napoleon Island on the Rhone-Rhine Canal, French defenders on raised platforms fired at German troops coming through grain fields, inflicting “severe losses.” Confusion at the battalion and regiment level was endemic. Units didn’t receive orders or lost them, and some commanders refused to launch frontal attacks when ordered. The Germans managed to retake Mulhouse, but it was a bloody affair.  So to sum up Mulhouse as my example from Alsace-Lorraine, we see a back-and-forth fight in woods, vineyards, and in populated areas. The fighting was chaotic, and costly frontal assaults were commonplace.   **The Ardennes**  Here, I’ll look at one specific case to demonstrate the nature of the fighting. Like we see in Alsace, fighting was confused and chaotic, and infantry often charged with little or no artillery support.   In mid-August, it was becoming more apparent to the French high command that the German right wing was disproportionally strong. French Fifth Army, under Lanrezac, moved up to counter German Second Army along the Sambre River on August 20. Initially, both sides were cautious. The British were en route, so the French toyed with waiting and advancing with allies on their left. Bulow, commander of German Second Army, wanted to maintain contact with the forces on his left and right, so he, too, was initially cautious. But by August 22, though, he was ready to attack, which he did with three corps.   The French, however, were also attacking. Two of Lanrezac’s corps commanders (those of III and X Corps) attacked without orders, and the subsequent fighting was a classic encounter battle: both sides simultaneously advancing against one another. I’ll quote Herwig’s description of the French advance. As you read this, keep in mind that the French troops wore bright red pants and blue tunics.   &gt;Without orders, Sauret and Defforges [the French corps commanders who attacked without orders] charged the German positions in the early-hour mists of 22 August, flags unfurled, bugles blaring, bayonets fixed---and without artillery support. Both attacks were brutally beaten back around Arsimons with “staggering losses.” Tenth Corps’ desperate bayonet charges were mowed down by the machine guns of the Prussian Guard; those of III Corps ran headlong into a fierce assault by Emmlich’s [German] X Corps. The fields were littered with six thousand French dead and wounded; the roads were soon clogged with thousands of Belgian civilians fleeing the deadly mayhem.   We can see here the problem and command and control rearing its ugly head again. Corps commanders attacked without official orders, and Lanrezac could do little about it. Keeping in touch with subordinate formations was difficult and often done via runners, not telephone. At the tactical level, units did not have radios linking them to artillery units further back. Battalions would get intermingled with one another and the whole scene would devolve into chaotic frontal assaults. 	human
475	"**The Marne**  By the time we get to the Marne, the French are already beginning to establish defensive positions and hold the line around Nancy, especially on the ridge of the Grand Couronne. Operationally, this decision was sound. The French commander, Joffre, was organizing a new Sixth Army around Paris, which would strike the Germans in the flank. Holding the Germans in place while Sixth Army swung around eventually won the battle.   Now, its key to remember here that these defenses were not like those we see later in the war. They were comparatively simple. Trench lines were usually short and disconnected. There were no great dugouts, pillboxes, or thick barbed wire barriers.   Bavarian Sixth Army threw itself against the Grand Couronne between 4 and 7 September but failed to dislodge the French. Tactically, the battle was fairly static, but we still see the back-and-forth fighting in attack and counterattack. Like in Alsace, there was also fighting in villages. Again, I’ll defer to Herwig for a description of the fighting on the 7th:  &gt;The Bavarians advanced out of the north from the Pont-a-Mousson Gateway and three times furiously stormed the north front of the Grand Couronne with flags unfurled and bands playing. The village of Sainte-Geneviere and the Mont Toulon Ridge commanding the southern side of the gateway witnessed brutal bayonet charges throughout the night . . . The forests around Nancy [saw] desperate bayonet charges. At one place, in the dark of the night two Bavarian soldiers of Gebsattel’s III Corps had bayoneted each other.   Yet again, we see frontal assaults through woods and villages, this time against defensive positions prepared in advance. Commanders resolved to take and maintain the initiative with hastily prepared but concentrated attacks that collapsed due to poor communications and a lack of artillery support.   **The Race to the Sea**  After the Marne, French Fifth and Sixth Armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) pursued the Germans to the Marne. The subsequent Battle of the Aisne transformed into static trench fighting between 14 and 17 September. With the line between Switzerland and the Aisne now stabilized, both sides sought to exploit the open flank between Albert and the sea.   Here, I’ll talk quickly about some of the fighting in Artois, and I’ll be turning to Herwig again.  Bavarian I Corps was part of German Sixth Army’s attempt to outflank the French in Artois. Under Fassbender, it moved on the line Lille-Douai-Arras on September 29. The advance was slow going. The area was fairly industrial and dotted with small villages. According to Fassbender, defending French forces would “surrender,” but troops behind them would open fire as Bavarian troops moved to apprehend the “prisoners” (a trick the Germans used earlier at the Aisne and would use again during the early stages of First Ypres).   The advance continued into October. Here, I’ll quote Fassbender, who wrote about the nature of the terrain and the difficulties of the attack (see Herwig, “Eyeball to Eyeball with the Enemy”):   &gt;All villages, without exception, are firmly enclosed complexes consisting of massive buildings with 1/2 meter thick stone walls . . . This type of construction obviously convinced the French to resort to fighting village to village . . . They defend the villages with inferior numbers thanks to the natural protection accorded by these buildings, and then hold the center in superior numbers. Whenever we encircle a village and enter it, the French shower us with fire from every window, slid, and cellar.   He continues:  &gt;We have to fight from house to house, to dig the enemy out of cellars and silos, or to kill them off by throwing hand grenades down their hiding places. The battle at all times is extremely costly . . . After such fights the villages take on the appearance of ruins. All churches including their steeples are destroyed, all roofs bared to the sky, the walls caved in, entire houses bared to the elements . . . Human and animal corpses litter the countryside.  In this more industrial region of France, the fighting was urban and house to house. French and German armies would throw up barricades in streets and defend them with machine guns and artillery. An effective way of flushing out the enemy was simply shelling the village, as Fassbender notes. You can see here how even this “open” combat quickly degenerated into tactically static fighting, even in the absence of complex trench networks.   **First Ypres**  First Ypres was, like the Ardennes, an encounter battle with both sides attacking simultaneously. German Sixth Army and a new German Fourth Army attacked toward La Basee and Ypres, respectively, while the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) moved from the west.  I could go on and on about Ypres, but I’ll keep it brief.   In the south, British II Corps advanced around La Basee beginning on October 20. Entrenching was common. Each night, British units would dig in. Then, in the morning, they’d move out, and at night, they’d dig a fresh set of defenses. Much of the initial fighting between armies was in the open. First were skirmishes between light infantry and cavalry. Quickly, however, the weight of the German attack threw the British onto the defensive.   In the north, the encounter phase was short, but there was still open combat. Again, units dug in each night during their advances. Fighting in woods was common. Like elsewhere in 1914, combat had a distinct back-and-forth flavor. A British unit would advance and push some Germans out of, say, a wood or small village. Then the Germans would shell the wood/village and force the British back to their trench lines. The Germans would then occupy the wood/village and subsequently come under British shell fire. Rinse and repeat.   After about 29 October, fighting around Ypres was deadlocked. It was semi-mobile in the sense that the front line remained somewhat fluid as both sides attacked, counterattacked, took and lost trench lines, but the fighting was hardly open like what we see in Alsace or the Ardennes.   **Conclusion**  After that long-winded response, I think I can boil down the nature of the open fighting with four common elements.  First was confusion. Communications at both the operational and tactical level were brutal. Between formations, phonelines were sparse or nonexistent, so messages were often relayed via runners. Orders were late, missing, or never delivered. At the tactical level, communication with superior formations or neighboring units was difficult without wireless radios.   Second, infantry typically attacked without artillery support. This is both the result of poor communications and poor tactics. While all sides acknowledged the significance of close artillery-infantry cooperation before the war, no one really figured out how to do it. As a result, we see infantry regularly attacking without support.   Third, fighting often occurred in woods, vineyards, farms, or villages. Taking a village was tactically significant and, in the case of Alsace, carried nationalistic importance. Villages also offered defenders shelter and in-built fortifications. Similarly, defenders in farms or woods had the luxury of much natural cover.    Finally, the casualties. My goodness, the casualties. Assaults were typically frontal attacks with bayonets fixed. This is partially the result of tactics and an emphasis on the offensive, but it’s also a result of bad communications and virtually no coordination between infantry and artillery. The results were catastrophic. I’ve said this before here, but I’ll say it again: the first few months of the war were by far the costliest of the war in terms of the size of the forces involved. The French had 265,000 dead in 1914. The BEF lost almost 90,000, more than its initial strength. The German army suffered 800,000 casualties between August and December. In this way, for all its woes, static trench warfare was far more sustainable than the alternative.

477	Thanks for introducing me to   Hildebert; I really like that poem! I find it surprisingly humanist and, for a Christian writer, almost sympathetic to the old human-made gods.  Because I'm that kind of person, I had to look at his words; I'm copying them here in case anyone's interested:  &gt; […] urbs cecidit, de qua si quicquam dicere dignum     &gt; moliar, hoc potero dicere ‘Roma fuit’.     &gt; non tamen annorum series, non flamma nec ensis     &gt; ad plenum potuit hoc abolere decus.     &gt; […] confer opes marmorque novum superumque favorem,     &gt; artificum vigilent in nova facta manus,     &gt; non tamen aut fieri par stanti machina muro,     &gt; aut restaurari sola ruina potest.     &gt; cura hominum potuit tantam componere Romam,     &gt; quantam non potuit solvere cura deum.     &gt; hic superum formas superi mirantur et ipsi,     &gt; et cupiunt fictis vultibus esse pares.     &gt; non putuit Natura deos hoc ore creare,     &gt; quo miranda deum signa creavit homo.     &gt; […]  He actually has *two* poems *De roma*; this one goes *Par tibi, Roma, nihil cum sis prope tota ruina / quam magni fueris integra, fracta does* (All these ruins still unparalleled, Rome, declare in the wreck how great were you whole...) , and the other, where Rome replies, starts with *Dum simulacra mihi, dum numina vana placerent, militia, populo, mœnibus alta fui* (while images mine, while powers vain yet pleased, I was great too in arms, in people, in walls...); apparently one's about the tragedy of the old Pagan Rome, and other about its new life as a Christian capital.  That explain the almost Pagan-sympathetic  undertones of *Par tibi, Roma…*; it's because the part where he praises Christianity is in a separate poem.  (Source: *Carmina minora*, A. B.

483	Adding to what’s already been said: The division azul consisted of a bit less than 50.000 soldiers in total. It was justified in the same way, as the Spanish Civil War before: Mainly as “holy crusade against the evils of Bolshevism”.  Contrary to the official propaganda, the soldiers motivations were quite diverse. People joined for fighting communism, but also communists joined for joining the Soviet side when in Russia. Officers went for better prospects for promotion, criminals for escaping prison and among the soldiers there were some veterans of the civil war and the colonial war in northern Morocco. The most recent and detailed study on the topic is the following, sadly only available in German, as far as I know: Xosé M. Núñez-Seixas: Die spanische Blaue Division an der Ostfront 1941-1945. Zwischen Kriegserfahrung und Erinnerung, Münster 2016.  As already mentioned, francoist Spain’s overall “neutrality” was mainly forced upon it by the devastations of the civil war, ironically in many ways caused by the Italian and German intervention. This, however, didn’t prevent the regime from selling the neutrality, after the war was lost for the axis powers, as a simple result of “Franco’s genius”.	human

The translator's notes very helpfully define for us what Benjamin means by ""parasang"" and ""day's journey,"" but not mile!  Benjamin writes that Kus is ""300 miles"" to Fayoum, and according to the editor Kus is halfway between Qena and Luxor. That gives a distance of ~330 modern miles according to Google maps, which seems close enough to the modern unit for someone measuring distance by guesstimate (since he writes elsewhere about being able to see ""100 miles"" from a vantage spot, and so forth)."	human

491	"The most common armour was scale body armour with a helmet of approximately conical or hemispherical shape. Surviving scales are commonly bronze, but bronze has an advantage in survival over rawhide and iron, which were also used. Descriptions of metal armour often describe it ""gold"" or ""silver"", which might refer to bronze and iron, respectively. Scale body armour could be either short, to the waist or hips, or long, covering to about knee level. Most armours appear to have been sleeveless or with short sleeves.  Next most common would be lamellar, either short or long, and sleeveless or short-sleeved, like scale armours. Again, surviving lamellae are often bronze, but rawhide and iron were used too.  Mail probably appears in the region in late antiquity, and was in use by the early 3rd century AD. The first major users of mail in the area appear to be the Sassanids.  There are some armours with long sleeves for the arms, notably cataphract armours. Scale sleeves were used, and art suggest lamellar sleeves. Sassanid armoured cavalry would typically have long mail sleeves. Horse armour was also in use. I don't recall seeing mail horse armour, but both scale and lamellar horse armour were used.  There was some use of plate armour, from the mid/late first millenium BC. Body armour included round plates used to protect the torso, and more complete plate cuirasses, but these seem to be much less common than scale/lamellar/mail which appear much more often in art. Plate greaves were used; this was quite likely Greek/Hellenistic influence.  H. Russell Robinson, ""Oriental Armour"" covers antiquity in the first chapter."	human

496	"Why does David Irving continue denial when witnesses existed?  Easy, Irving is mercantile scum who cares about making money and selling his books. He does not care about the proper historical method despite all of his pretenses.   In their book *Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?*, Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman also postulate that Irving has more venal and personal reasons for his denialism. Although Irving was never part of the official historical profession, he does seem to take particular relish in using his books to thumb his nose at the ""professionals"" who have rightly rejected his work. In letters defending himself in the run-up and during the Lipstadt trial he took his identity as a non-professional historian as a badge of honor. Sherman and Grobman also note he has to an extent been trapped by his denialism, but this is a very lucrative cul-de-sac. Looking at Irving's current career, they observe:  &gt;Seemingly, the more he revises the Holocaust, the more books he sells and the more lecture invitations he receives from denier and right-wing groups. The irony is that he appears, in our opinion, to have little respect for the people who constitute his most receptive audience, an audience far outside the mainstream academy. He told the journalist Ron Rosenbaum [in the book *Explaining Hitler*]: ""I find it odious to be in the same company as these people. There is no question that there are certain organizations that propagate these theories which are cracked antisemites."" But, he adds, ""what else can I do? If I've been denied a platform worldwide, where else can I make my voice heard? As soon as I get onto regular debating platforms I shall shake off this ill-fitting shoe which I'm standing on at present. I'm not blind. I know these people have done me a lot of damage, a lot of harm, because I get associated with those stupid actions.""  What is apparent in the Rosenbaum quote is that there is a strong undercurrent of self-pity  in Irving's defense of the path he has taken.   Whether he likes it or not, he has thrown his lot in with various far-right wing groups. And for all his pathos about an ill-fitting shoe, this has been a very lucrative deal for Irving. At one point in the aughts, he managed to rent out an apartment in Queen Anne's Gate that cost  £6,000-a-month. His denialism has a built-in audience to buy his books regardless of their quality or pay for him to speak at various lectures. Established authors working in the publishing industry like /u/mikedash can tell you more about the often cutthroat world of publishing. Irving was a pioneer in online hate and the Institute for Historical Review transitioned very quickly from a costly print journal to a cheap webpage (and don't give them hits, but take it on me, their webpage design is very *dated*). Like its  descendants, the IHR is as much about hawking the owners' merchandise as it is about carping on Zionist control of the media.

And then one suggesting that maybe the one constant across each universe would be Oppenheimer — some kind of strange, irreplaceable creature...   If you liked ""Manhattan"" you should also check out ""Wormwood"" by Errol Morris — not the same kind of thing, really, but I think they pair well together. ""Wormwood"" gives a glimpse of some of the stuff that might have happened on the show if it had kept going. It was a real shame that it got cancelled — the writers and showrunners would have LOVED to continue with the plot through the Cold War, because ""Manhattan"" is really about the transformation of the American psyche and moral code, more than it is about Los Alamos, per se."	human
501	"Any basic fashion history text will probably do the trick for you - I tend to have issues with all of the ones I come across because they oversimplify the narrative and sometimes repeat misconceptions, but if you're looking for a broad guide, they'll work well. *Fashion: The Definitive History of Costume and Style*, from the Smithsonian is good; Norah Waugh's *The Cut of (English?)Women's Clothes* and *The Cut of Men's Clothes* are really good, but harder to find in a library system.  The frill on the linked shirt is called a *jabot* - these started to be added to shirts in the early 18th century as the cravat was replaced by the stock, a band of gathered fabric that buckled around the neck; the stock and jabot together gave the impression of one long, tied cravat. I think maybe by ""frilly"" you mean the way it's gathered at the neck and at the tops and ends of the sleeves, though? The body and sleeves being large enough to require gathering to fit allowed a lot more space for the body to move underneath it."	human
502	This question pops up here from time to time.    The first people who would really want to solve this problem were merchants.  If you're a Greek merchant travelling to England to buy , say, treacle, how do you avoid carrying a lot of hard currency- gold or silver- with you?  The obvious thing is to find a merchant in your area who's selling something Greek- like olive oil- to England, and so knows an English merchant with whom he does business.  You pay him: for a fee he gives you a letter of credit (sometimes just called a note) for that English merchant.  When you land in London you look up that merchant, present your letter of credit. That merchant would likely  discount that letter and not give you the whole value.  How much he discounted it would depend on how much he trusted you, the Greek merchant...or he might refuse to accept the note at all, or refuse the note until he'd verified it.  But you can see it would be very useful for everyone concerned: the Greek merchant makes some money, the English merchant makes some money, and the English merchant now has a credit in Greece and so can put that against the next purchase of olive oil instead of hauling gold or silver to Greece.   That English merchant might realize that he's in a very handy position.  If the Greek is buying treacle that's going to be shipped to Greece,  and he knows a treacle merchant in England, why go to England at all? Far easier to just write to the treacle merchant and place an order.  But the Greek merchant sent him , somehow, the money, how would he know the treacle merchant wouldn't just pocket it, and never send the treacle?  And if he told the treacle merchant to first send  the treacle and he'd pay him on arrival, how would the treacle merchant know that he'd actually do that?  The solution is to find a third party to hold the money- that English merchant who already does business in Greece. And that English merchant would find it very, very  handy, if there's a lot of this sort of transferring to be done, to actually maintain an office in Greece. 	human
503	"If you're referring to the ""myth"" of aircraft being highly effective tank-killers in World War II, the ""when"" is at the time, largely based on claims by pilots. All air claims were hard to verify and overstated, and small targets on the ground were particularly difficult to positively identify and judge the results of attacks against. Rigorous analysis of causes of tank knockouts was difficult, and not always undertaken or widely available, to be able to provide evidence for or against air claims.  Starting with the German invasion of France in 1940, for example, Stukas (and the Hs 123s of II.(Schlacht)/LG 2) were credited with defeating Allied tank attacks in instances such as Montcornet, Arras and Cambrai. Both German and Soviet aircraft claimed large numbers of tanks destroyed during the battle of Kursk in 1943, and Allied fighter-bombers over Normandy in 1944 also claimed large numbers of tanks including during the Mortain counterattack mentioned by /u/The_Chieftain_WG . Various contemporary and post-war accounts reflect such claims, e.g. of Mortain ""The intervention of the Tactical Air Forces, especially the rocket-firing Typhoons, was decisive."" (*The Royal Air Force 1939-1945, Volume III: The Fight is Won*).   The ""myth-busting"" is, as far as I'm aware, more recent, such as Brereton Greenhous in the 1980s, e.g. *Aircraft vs Armor: Cambrai to Yom Kippur*, Ian Gooderson in the 1990s on the Allied tactical air forces, Nigel Askey's [Combat Aircraft Versus Armour In WWII] (http://www.operationbarbarossa.net/combat-aircraft-versus-armour-in-wwii/) looking at Kursk and Normandy. These focus on the few cases of actually destroyed tanks that can be attributed to bombs and rockets to give a more accurate picture of air power, though as sometimes happens with myth-busting the scales can tip a bit far the other way (e.g. Askey's comparisons of German tank and Allied air losses aren't particularly relevant, as 2nd TAF engaged a far wider array of targets than tanks alone).   The more balanced works now take into account the difficulty aircraft had in actually destroying tanks, but the important work they performed in restricting movement, causing damage, hitting soft-skinned targets, and the psychological impact of air attack (e.g. Gooderson's entire thesis/book, Peter C. Smith on the Stukas at Montcornet: ""Although direct hits on such targets as tanks were rare, the use of the new fragmentation bombs on theses occasions, which stripped the tracks from the tanks and rendered them inoperable, was critical."")"	human
504	"Thanks for your work! And you are correct as to Oppenheimer  and his portrayal - he was definitely a strange cat and I think Manhattan did get some of that right. One quibble though - I think it's might be a bit of a stretch to call Oppenheimer in Dwight Shultz's interpretation ""Feel Good."" It was not the best of movies, and that was one part that lacked, but it wasn't that bad.   Admittedly, the movie suffered more than a couple of historical problems around the fictionalized character played by John Cusack, even if his and Laura Dern's characters were some of the more interesting from a dramatic point of view. It also was not the most entertaining of movies, and skipped over a lot of the human element for a heavy dose of the science. But it did get key elements of the history right, key elements lacking in Manhattan (not, I'm sure, for your lack of trying!).  Newman's portrayal of Groves was pretty good, despite some of the less quality writing he had to work with. Historians too often treat Groves as the caricature the scientists at Los Alamos portrayed him as. Some of that is in that movie, but I still think the movie was one of the few portrayals to get some elements of the relationship between Oppenheimer and Groves right. They were an odd pair, but they worked well together.   I did appreciate that the makers of Manhattan tried to incorporate some of the broader elements of the Manhattan program and areas of the history not usually portrayed, and many of these were very well done. I was disappointed Groves did not make much of an appearance, and a lot of things about the show were just too ""alternative"" for me.  Manhattan continually lost me at some of the more fanciful plot elements, and the portrayal of the Army and the military's counter-intelligence efforts, I felt, were both counter-factual and unfair bits of fantasy at many points - especially in the first season.   I realize the writers were trying to make points about more recent, contemporary issues, and tell fictional stories, but it was quite laughable at several points, if you know the actual history. The elements of history they got right were great, but they were usually about set design/background details, or too infrequent.  It was in those fanciful moments the show lost its appeal for me. I could appreciate it as a drama, but as history, it felt sometimes more of, as you suggest, ""alternative history"" with a particular spin to it that I found both preachy and unfair to some of the actual historical figures involved in the project. Further, there were significant aspects of the real history it monkeyed with that made for a good drama, but were historically inaccurate in the extreme.  In my own assessment, Fat Man lacked the dramatic elements that made Manhattan fun to watch, but made less use of dramatic license in telling the history. Fat Man also treated some of the actual historical figures with a lighter touch/more respect. Probably because more than a few of them were still around when that movie came out. Fat Man also adopted a significantly less judgemental tone at various points that Manhattan seemed to indulge itself with at too frequent opportunities.   Fat Man was/is still a pretty boring movie though, especially if you aren't a physics geek or don't know the history already. It is a cliff notes version with a little drama for effect.  Manhattan was a much more entertaining show to watch and one that regularly served up surprises, but only lightly dealt with the real history or the science.   One was heavy on history/science, light on drama, the other swung the other direction. Neither, unfortunately, hit the mark. I'd love to see someone do with the Manhattan Project what the Norwegians/British did with Kampen om tungtvannet (The Heavy Water War) and Heisenberg or what the BBC did in The Space Race and von Braun.   There is a great story to tell about the Manhattan project and the Soviet bomb program (as Richard Rhodes did in both his books), but it is still waiting for the right people to tell it. In this age of peak TV it deserves a quality mini-series, one with drama AND history. The true story has more than enough of both. "	human

506	I'm a descendent of Polish Holocaust survivors. As a child, I was told a horrible story: After the war, my grandparents returned to their hometown to see who was left, and the residents laughed at them, saying they thought they had been killed in the war. No remorse at all. Nearly their entire families had been killed in the ghettoes and camps, after enduring years of anti-Semitism prior to the war, and my grandmother in particular spent the rest of her life in a state of emotional anguish. They never returned to Poland again.	human
507	I think you're thinking of Loyalists, Federalists, and Anti-Federalist Republicans as being all from the same era, which they were not.  Loyalists were strictly around and vocal during the years leading up to and the years throughout the American Revolution.  By the time it was over, many either had or would leave the newly established United States for Great Britain or another colony, most popular was parts of eastern Canada.  The establishment of Federalists/Anti-Federalists did not come about until *years* after the war concluded.  Both sides were active in the early years of the Republic, especially during Washington's second term in office, with [Federalists](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Federalist-Party) backing such figures as John Adams and Alexander Hamilton and [Anti-Federalist, Democratic-Republicans](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Democratic-Republican-Party), backing figures like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.  Loyalists played no role because they had essentially backed the wrong horse.  Whether Federalist or Democratic Republican, people who made up these parties on both sides were either patriot or  neutral (it's estimated that 40% - 50% of the American public were neutral during the war) during the war.   But if you're asking why did Loyalists who remain in the United States not try and be more active in American politics? Well, the reason is rather simple.  Loyalists, especially members of the gentry who would have been in a position to attain political power, were largely disrespectful to the American masses.  As award-winning historian Alan Taylor put it:   &gt; The newly aggressive politics of common men troubled many gentlemen. Gouverneur Morris of New York worried, “The mob begins to think and to reason. . . . I see it with fear and trembling, that if the disputes with Britain continue, we shall be under the domination of a riotous mob.” He concluded that the “mobility grow dangerous to the gentry, and how to keep them down is the question.” The revolution divided gentlemen, with the most conservative becoming Loyalists who defended British rule as essential to social stability. But Patriot gentlemen felt more confident that they could manage the common people. James Duane advised, “Let [the people] be rather followed than driven.” Cadwallader Colden noted that “gentlemen of property” took charge of Patriot committees lest “the most dangerous men among us would take the lead.” **While Loyalist leaders dreaded the politicized common people, genteel Patriots hoped to control them**.  &gt; Both Patriots and Loyalists were cross-class coalitions led by rival gentlemen who rallied common supporters. In the northern colonies the wealthy divided, but the richest southerners overwhelmingly became Patriots (or “Whigs”). “There were in no part of America more determined Whigs than the opulent slaveholders in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia,” recalled David Ramsay of South Carolina. Where the gentlemen of a county united, for one side or the other, they drew almost all of their neighbors with them. **But in many counties, gentlemen divided into rival camps and competed for popular support...Loyalists claimed to defend true American liberty, for they regarded Patriot committees and mobs as greater threats to freedom than the small taxes levied by Parliament**. (1)  So you can see, Loyalists sort of shot themselves in their own collective feet during the American Revolution and remained just as loathed after the fighting stopped. This happened even after the Treaty of Paris guaranteed some protections to the Loyalists, yet many if not most Loyalists did not find the protections that it guaranteed.   So why didn't Loyalists find a place for themselves in the new government? They were alienated from start, with many fleeing the country in order to avoid further repercussions for their politics during the war.   1).

There are some made up stories and characters in it, but those aren't the kind of things depicted in TW games. In addition, there are histories of the Three Kingdoms, not just the famous Romance, as well as all the other sorts of archaeological evidence you'd expect from the time period, which they could draw on as sources for making the game.  The most famous of these are the Records of the Three Kingdoms, which were written within living memory of the historical events.  Also Total War fans complaining about historical accuracy is pretty hilarious.	human
510	Well, the USSR was a command economy and drawing a comparison to the US grain market is not an apt one. The export decisions were made at the highest state levels and were part of a deliberate policy. While the US government is definitely involved in agribusiness (eg subsidies, tariffs, etc.), its direct fingerprint is less apparent than in the Soviet case.  The outsized role of the central state was only aspect that makes this Stalinist. The export drive was done without any real thought to its social costs and consequences. The decision-makers within the Poliburo naively assumed that growth and expanding requisition quotas could be maintained by executive fiat. This was a recipe for disaster. The Soviet agricultural sector emerged from the war and civil war quite battered and while things had improved under NEP, the USSR's agricultural output was still highly inefficient. Collectivization made things worse, drastically so in its first years, while strengthening state control over the USSR's agricultural sector. The decision to increase exports thus had real costs for the Soviet population with famine in the early years and persistent food shortages throughout the 1930s. As Stephen Wheatcroft and R. W. Davies note in the preface for their *The Years of Hunger*:  &gt; The good harvest of 1930 led to the decisions to export substantial amounts of grain in 1931 and 1932. The Soviet leaders also assumed that the wholesale socialisation of livestock farming would lead to the rapid growth of meat and dairy production. These policies failed, and the Soviet leaders attributed the failure not to their own lack of realism but to the machinations of enemies. Peasant resistance was blamed on the kulaks, and the increased use of force on a large scale almost completely replaced attempts at persuasion. Largely through their own fault, the Politburo had led the economy into an impasse. By the time the famine was looming over the country at the end of 1932, only an appeal for foreign assistance through grain imports would have stood any chance of avoiding famine. The Politburo did not even contemplate the public admission of failure which this would entail.  So it is not just increasing output that made this decision Stalinist, but rather the whole host of precepts that undergird it as well as the often callous indifference to the consequences of these decisions.   So while the history of US agribusiness is not exactly a complimentary one, it is not really Stalinist in its ethos. 	human

Stockings played the part of the shirt or shift for the lower body, covering up the skin and taking the brunt of laundering, and likewise coming in a huge variety of qualities, from hand-knitted linen ""thread"" stockings to those machine-knitted from silk.

We have ample documentary evidence of young bachelors sending both shirts and stockings home for proper laundering, or requesting the same new.

Atatürk had little part in the negotiations but he was ultimately the one who convinced İnönü to sign the treaty.  Every country that fought in the war had its own agenda. They all mostly wanted land, with the exception of Britain who also wanted to make sure the subcultures within Turkey would be safe and treated equally, though this was quite low on their list of demands.

522	&gt; I was disappointed Groves did not make much of an appearance,  Many of these kinds of things had to do with casting and things like that. They had wanted to have Groves be involved but something fell through, if I recall, with the actor who was going to play him. So they had to have a not-very-historical Stimson show up occasionally as a stand in (which they were well aware was totally silly). It was an interesting job — they wanted to do things that were not historical but they wanted to also know when they were passing into the very ahistorical or not. Many of the things in the show though were less ahistorical than a lot of people realize; in the second season in particular nearly ever plot point was based around some actual historical event, just taken to more extremes than reality. There were, for example, [plots to lock up scientists who didn't play ball](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/10/23/the-plot-against-leo-szilard/), a few [suspicious deaths](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/12/11/the-curious-death-of-oppenheimers-mistress/), and [over-the-top news reporters running around the project](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/10/30/the-improbable-william-laurence/). There was a subplot that didn't quite get fully realized about a rogue judge making trouble for the project — that was based on actual issues that took place at Hanford with land seizure cases.   I think if the show had continued another season the moral questions would have been allowed to get much murkier — the really important and fascinating stuff was yet to come. Oh well. 	human

In 1944, the Home Army carried out a massive uprising against the Nazis in Warsaw (following another uprising in the Warsaw ghetto the previous year), which the Nazis managed to put down at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives, including 250,000 Polish civilians. After the uprising was suppressed, the Nazis deported and killed additional hundreds of thousands of Poles in retaliation and systematically demolished most of Warsaw, block by block.

526	The impact of CGI on media presentation of dinosaurs is complicated.   On one hand, the CGI revolution in special effects (VFX) was path-breaking. *Jurassic Park* was special in that its digital VFX were top-notch and aged (with some exceptions) rather well. But CGI dramatically lowed the cost of reproducing dinosaurs on both big and small screens. Network TV shows like [*Sliders*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So8_vXdPkWE) or syndicated shows like [*Star Trek: Voyager*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjuptfaTqyo) or [*The Lost World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bDIulgCP1w) could and did feature CGI dinosaurs. This did raise the public image of dinosaurs and allowed for them to be seen in a variety of media.   However, this VFX revolution was in more than a few ways a continuation of a trend rather than a radical departure. Recreation of dinosaurs had always been one of the major components of cutting-edge VFX work. One of the first animated shorts was 1914's [*Gertie the Dinosaur*](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AWinsor_McCay_(1914)Gertie_the_Dinosaur.webm). Stop-motion pioneers like Willis O'Brien worked with dinosaurs; O'Brien's first major work was 1915's [*The Dinosaur and the Missing Link*](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AThe_Dinosaur_and_the_Missing_Link.ogv) and while it is defientely crude by the standards set by O'Brien later in [the original *King Kong*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvD3X3RcK3Y), it was a start. The linked *Kong* segment also shows how dinosaurs were involved in early VFX of [rear- and miniature-projection](https://emoryfx.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/kongmake1.gif) and other composite shots. These composite shots allowed for humans to interact on screen with the dinosaurs, allowing for the illusion that the dinosaurs were real. Part of the selling point of these VFX shots was selling a supposedly realistic recreation of extinct megafauna. *The Valley of Gwangi*, animated by the redoubtable  Ray Harryhausen has [one scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3J5TEx5rPc) in which cowboys interrupts a juvenile ornithomimus's meal only to chase it into the jaws of the eponymous Gwangi, a hybrid between a T. rex and and Allosaurus. The presence of the former dinosaur as well as [Styracosaurus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leLKC7dgjOw) does illustrate how Harryhausen was trying to break out of the Triceratops/T. rex/ sauropod-Frankenstein that typified most standard VFX of dinosaurs and depict some greater variety in the VFX.   Not all VFX artists prior to CGI could be Harryhausen or O'Brien nor could production companies spare the time and resources to perfect VFX work. Both the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt8QVvfZ6sM) and [1991 remake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DyHNugueOs ) of *Land of the Lost* had some shoddy stop-motion and puppet dinosaurs.  As with other innovations in VFX, the results varied too with a lot of 1990s CGI looking quite dated by the standards of 2018.  The impact of CGI was to drastically lower the threshold for decent dinosaur VFX so that even small production companies could fit dinosaurs into their stories. 	human
527	Let me preface this by saying I’m not a historian of the Black Death but this book I’m reading now called “A Distant Mirror” by Barbara W Tuchman, which was recommended to me by my professor,  claims that no they did not keep up. Pope Clement VI found it necessary to grant remission of sins to all who died of the plague because so many people were dying without the last rites. Further, lay people were allowed to administer last rites in case no priest could be found. Priests died at the same rate as lay people so sometimes you couldn’t find a priest; other times they just didn’t want to come for fear of death. 	human

This is not necessarily true in the slightest. Your Bachelor's yeah, you'll shell out lots of money. HOWEVER, I strongly recommend going  to the best in-state school in your state for your BA when you are ready to transfer out of your community college.  There's no reason to shell out tens of thousands of dollars for a degree like this when, honestly, where you get your BA is not nearly as important as where you get your MA or especially your PhD.   Second, once you are close to graduating, then start looking at Master's programs or PhD programs at strong *research* universities.  This is incredibly important for two reasons. One, if you don't go to a top school (At least a top 200 school by US News and World Report for MA or a top 50 school for PhD) your chances of getting a good job in your field begins to shrink -- this is especially true for the PhD. We had an opening two years ago for a Chinese history professor position and had over 100 applications! Those who didn't attend a top 50 school (for PhD) were almost instantly cut from the start.    Second, research universities often times have scholarships for students!  Almost all of my graduate school was paid for by my university (my first year I had my left over GI bill money to cover me, so I didn't need it).  Research universities what their students to a make great project or thesis, so they reward students with funding.  Second, I don't think there is a historian who works at a university in the USA who would tell you to get a PhD that was NOT funded by the university. PhDs are not only expensive in and of themselves, but they also usually require time to do travel and research and if they aren't paying for it, it's not worth it UNLESS you already have a great job and you need a PhD to advance there -- then it makes sense to spend the extra money. The history profession is too bloated with Academic historians right now to justify shelling out too much money.  &gt; History is my life, but I want to be able to support a family too.   You can absolutely do this, but begin asking important questions now. What would you want to do. Would you be willing to become an academic librarian or work in an archive or a historical research center? These are careers paths too.    I also want to mention one final thing. When you say 'history is my life', I can tell you are passionate, but please be aware that being a professional historian of *any* type isn't simply about reading and remembering facts. It's much more complicated. It's usually about conducting original research, making new discoveries, and being able to articulate it through *powerful* and *persuasive* language.  How is your writing skills? How are your analytical skills and evaluating evidence? How are you at debates? These are all important skills you'll need to perfect.  Please let me know if you have any other questions!	human
530	"I think the confusion arises from the different sorts of Dyes uses.  The ""Royal purple"" was Tyrian Dye, made from the shell of sea snails, known then as Murex, but possibly a host of different species.   This was a speciality dye of the city of Tyre, and was praised for it's color fastness and rich and impressive color.    Now, is that the only way to get a red dye?  No!  One of the easiest  means is the cultivation and production of Madder, a relatively easy to grow family of plants.   We have archaeological evidence of madder dye from the 3rd century BCE in India, Tutankamen had linen dyed with madder, and Pliny the Elder mentions Madder growing near rome.   I believe there are also finds from Pompeii that show the use of madder in roman industry for dye.     It goes to reason that where lower classes wear red, they are not wearing Tyrian Red, but likely some form of madder red.   The two are visually distinctive, and I don't think you would easily confuse the two."	human

538	"The continuation of Monstrelet's chronicle, (the main body of which stops in 1444) which is in large part cribbing from the *Grandes Chronique's de France* as well as Jean Chartier has this to say:  "". . . the grand Turk with a numerous army of Saracens had invaded Christendom; that he had already conquered the noble of city of Constantinople and almost all Greece; that he had captured **the emperor of Greece**, had caused caused him to be inhumanly beheaded. . .""  And accuses the Sultan of various other terrible deeds that he didn't do, like burning down Hagia Sophia which is blatantly untrue and totally counter to Mehmet's policy towards Orthodox Christians. This account comes from a letter from the Pope to the Duke of Burgundy, who is urged to go on crusade against the Turks.  In a later chapter the siege of Constantinople is actually described (because that's how the continuation of Monstrelet rolls) and the conflict is clearly presented as between Turks and Christians; not Romans. This is due to the coalition that was defending Constantinople. The chronicle here refers to ""The emperor of Constantinople"".  The continuation *does* mention Rome, but not in association with the Byzantines:  "". . . the grand Turk, when only twenty-tree or twenty-four years old, was more cruel than Nero, and delighted in shedding blood: he was bold and ambitious, and more ardent to conquer the world than Alexander or Caesar.""  Later, as this Chronicler is setting out his grand and definitely plausible plan for a great crusade he says:  "". . . the Greeks will be anxious to recover their lands by the sword""  Again, Byzantium is clearly conceived of as a lost Greek empire; there's no association in the chronicle between it and Rome. Where allusions to antiquity are coming up they're in comparing Mehmet to ancient conquerors.  The Chronicler then makes up a letter from the Sultan to the Pope:  ""We marvel, therefore, and grieve, that the Italians should be our enemies - for we are naturally inclined to be attached to them, as being, like to ourselves, of the issue of the trojan race, and of ancient birth. We are sprung from the same blood, and regularly descended from king Priam and his line. . .""  Again, there's an attempt to locate the Turks within the context of the classical past. Indeed the Aeniad quite famously attempts to connect the Romans to the Trojans.  Another interesting passage:  ""We have also the intention of restoring Troy the great, and to avenge the blood of Hector and the queen Ixion, by subjecting to our government the *empire of Greece* and punishing the descendants of the transgressors.""  This is actually pretty definitive in establishing a link between classical Greece and the Byzantine Empire and not classical Rome in the mind of this chronicler (again, he's putting words in the Sultan's mouth here).  The Chronicler also denies the Venetians a claim to the Roman past:  ""we know the Venetians to be a distinct people, in their manners and laws, from the Romans.""  Then he has Mehmet invoke Jupiter and assorted other Roman gods.  So, let's call this a Franco-Burgundian perspective. The Chronicler himself is a shameless partisan of the Duke of Burgundy and the stuff he cribs from Chartier and the *Grandes Chroniques* represents the French perspective. He is, clearly, part of a long medieval tradition of identifying the Byzantine Empire as Greek, as the Greek Empire. He shows no knowledge of Constantinople's ties to ancient Rome, looking instead to classical Greece for historical parallel. To the Chronicler the fall of Constantinople represented a major blow to the Christian world. You can see this is just how much space he devotes to it - the continuation is fixated on France in a way that Monstrelet himself was not, so this is quite the exception. But, it does not appear to this chronicler to have represented the fall of the Roman Empire in any meaningful sense.  Jean de Waurin, another Burgundian chronicler, of this period, gives very similar details. I'll spare you the horrors of my attempts to translate it into English but again, it's described as the conquest of ""Constantinople and almost all of Greece"". Again, as we saw with Pseudo-Monstrelet the focus is on Constantinople as a Christian city. Indeed Waurin's account of all this is almost identical to what I've already discussed.   Whilst I'm not even going to try and claim that I can speak for the writers of any other region than those that I've mentioned I hope this gives you some idea of how the fall of Constantinople was perceived in French and Burgundian chroniclers. The event was a big enough deal that we could be here all day going through the reactions to it in Christian histories and art.  Famously, Mehmet himself *did* recognise the connection between Constantinople and Rome and titled himself 'Kayser-i Rum'. But the couple of books on Ottoman history I have don't really go into this, so hopefully somebody else can give you actual detail.  The divorce of the Byzantine Empire from its Roman legacy came about fairly early on; centuries before the city fell. A good example of this is in Liudprand of Cremona's history of the Reign of Otto I from the 10th century. Here Liutprand is already referring to the Byzantines as Greeks, for example: ""At this same period Simeon of Bulgaria began to press the Greeks very hard."" Nevertheless, Liutprand is well aware of the connections between Byzantium and Rome, for example when he's attempting to insult the Emperor Nikephoras he says ""For us the word Roman is comprehended every form of lowness"". This is shortly after the Emperor has tried to insult Liutprand by pointing out that his people, the Lombards, aren't Romans.  Sources:     Enguerrand de Monstrelet, *Chronicles*, trans.

The following is the last paragraph of the Vodka section (pgs. 14-16): ""The universal tradition of 'one for the road,' was put to excessive use by some of Russia's nobility in its illustrious past."" 'One for the road,' would be adhered to at the party, followed by 'one for the stirrup,' in the courtyard. And amazingly when a lucky guest had managed to escape this hospitality and out of sight of the over-eager host, a rider was dispatched to chase them down with more charkas of vodka for their 'one for over the hill.' Sadly the heralding of the age of the automobile put an end to this uniquely Russian custom.

543	"I am afraid I can't cover the entirety of your question, as it deals with different countries and their relations with the Nazi Regime. I also apologize for the large use of quotation marks but there is an inherent unpleasantness with the language, that I can't help but feel.  I have discussed [the issue of Fascist antisemitism here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7hkz5x/just_how_racistantisemitic_was_mussolini/) but I'll summarize it a bit in the following. If you are looking more to the German relations with ther allies in the Context of the Holocaust, I hope someone else can provide further details.   As for Italy though, the Germans did pursue the extermination of the Italian Jews with remarkable vigor. Of the 7,495 Italian Jews collected by the Nazi occupation forces and the collaborating Salò Regime to be deported towards the extermination camps in the early months of 1944, 6,885 would die there.   To put these numbers in their right context it must be understood that the Fascist Regime as a whole never saw the extermination of the Jews as one of its central goals. There was no pre-existent ""Jewish question"" in Italy, since the Italian Jewish community was both small (around 50,000 - it would have probably been a bit larger if the German legisation had been adopted for census purposes) and well adjusted. While there is no conclusive statistical evidence, arguments could be made for Italian Jews being well represented both within the Regime and the State administration up until the turn of 1936-39 that led to the introduction of racial legislation in 1938.    While there is reason to believe that Mussolini - with other Fascist leaders such as Giuseppe Bottai - had in the late 1930s developed a more ""racial oriented"" vision of that conflict of peoples/races/cultures, that according to his view drove historical evolution, this still didn't bring him to advocate for any systematic extermination.  Racial legislation in Italy took the form of a sort of ""segregation"" as it was both modeled on the German Nuremberg Laws of 1935 (and the subsequent legislation) and inspired by the ""necessities"" of keeping the Italians from ""mixing"" with the locals in the new Italian Empire. Once this goal was accomplished the Italians did not consider surrendering their Jews to Germany. Such an action, besides offering no immediate advantage to the Regime, would also have risked antagonizing the Church - the Church looked with major concern at the presumption of a government to judge of the religion of its citizens.  Even in 1943, the first steps of the Salò Regime did not involve deporting the Jews (the Italian administrations applied here a sort of mild passive resistence - in short complying very slowly) but rather robbing them of whatever properties they had left to sustain the wavering finances of the puppet state.   To add to this those individuals within the Regime that were more inclined to cooperate with the Nazis - Roberto Farinacci and notorious antisemite Giovanni Preziosi - were not by the late 1930s on Mussolini's good side. Especially Preziosi was more or less openly disliked by him.   The result was that, until Italy remained for Germany a valuable ally, talks of surrendering the Jews were not openly held - I am not aware of general inquiries, but I assume they might have taken place to some degree after the war begun.   Only when the Fascist Regime fell and the Nazis - now in their fully radicalized state - propped up the puppet Regime of Salò, could they pressure Mussolini into establishing an office for race and demographics (March 1944) under Preziosi's control, which worked essentially as a ""deportation office"" that allowed the Germans to take those Jews that still lived in the regions controlled by the Salò State.    Those who lived in the South (or who had found some degree of protection in Rome) were thus able to escape."	human

551	"This is an intriguing and also delightfully gross question! I have never seen any scholarship to suggest sanitary repercussions for ""kissing the ring"", either with the Pope specifically or in a feudal context generally, but in the specific case of ""the"" Papal ring -- the ""ring of the fisherman"" -- the relatively short lifespan of the ring itself depending on the lifespan of the specific Pope and the materials of its construction may explain that. Each such ring, due to symbolic reasons and its practical functions as a personal seal for the presiding Pope, is removed from the Pope's corpse and destroyed upon the death of that Pope to prevent complications like forgery. The construction of other papal rings may vary in accordance with each Pope's individual tastes and prevailing historical fashions (any given 16th century Pope likely wore more jewelry than any given 20th century Pope, for instance -- check out Raphael's [portrait of Pope Julius II](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Pope_Julius_II.jpg), wearing six rings) but each successive ring of the fisherman may only be worn under ceremonial circumstances (again, depending on the prevailing taste of the pontiff in question) and may even be worn over gloves. In addition to day-to-day attention given to precious-metal jewelry and any bacterial resistance inherent to the ring's materials (typically gold) even the sickest person to appear before the Pope and kiss his ring isn't likely to be bestowing a wet, sloppy kiss before the next guy takes his turn. So there's some risk of transference of germs between people paying their respects, as well as between Pope and ring-kisser, but in practical terms, relative to other transmission routes for germs and viruses (breathing the same air in an enclosed space, coughs and sneezes, kissing the more porous material of the shoe on the Pope's foot, etc.) the risk seems negligible. In historical terms I have yet to see even a small disease outbreak attributed to specifically this ceremonious transaction.   By at least the Early Modern era, it was accepted that objects handled by sick people were capable of transmitting contagion, even if the exact mechanism of that wasn't known -- you'll get dying priests locking themselves in their rooms and giving detailed accounts of what they handled in their last hours so no latecomers will contaminate themselves by handling a prayer-book or a set of keys, for instance. It seems reasonable that contemporaries of the ring-kissing phenomenon's golden age might have understood that prolonged proximity between a sick person and the Pope, or a well person kissing a sick Pope, might transmit disease. The Pope's own state of illness or health during the Renaissance and Early Modern era would have been a matter of public concern and knowledge. But whether they valued the religious transactions of such audiences and gestures over the individual risks, I can't say. "	human
552	Precise uniform color is the kind of historical accuracy I don't care about. Also, I don't understand 'alright to make it straight straight up fantasy'.  To what does the 'it' refer to?  Let me give a couple examples of what I mean.  The way pike units operate doesn't really match their historical usage.  Another example is the depiction of republic era Roman infantry as superior on a unit to unit basis (they weren't, the Romans won most of their wars thru better logistics and attrition, not because their soldiers were super elite).   Admittance, maybe I was a bit harsh.  However, there are already loads of characters in Total War games who didn't exist historically and most of the events in a given Total War game divergence from history (this is part of the fun), likewise TW games are based on biased sources (e.g. virtually all of our sources in antiquity are from a Greek/Roman perspective).  These are the main critiques I would envision someone make for using Romance of the Three Kingdoms as a source, but they largely would apply to TW games in general.	human
553	"Broadly speaking, the Soviets got to annex portions of Finland, prewar Germany, Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary as well as absorb the Baltic states entirely for two interrelated reasons.   One, it certainly helped the Soviets that a number of these countries were part of the Axis powers. The Romanian, Hungarian, and Finnish governments all allied with Germany and participated in the attack on the USSR. This aided the Soviet case for territorial readjustment internationally because there was relatively little sympathy for states that had made common cause with Hitler. Even though Finland did not declare war on the US, its alliance with Germany led to a drawdown in diplomatic relations between the two countries and a distinct chill in US-Finnish relations. The German alliance had trapped Helsinki into a diplomatic  cul-de-sac in which it found few potential non-Soviet patrons to get it out of the Axis alliance. This *persona non grata* status was repeated with all of the minor Axis powers to some degree where they had very little room to maneuver after it became clear Germany was going to lose the war. And while the diplomacy of the minor Axis was now constrained, the exact opposite process happened with Stalin. The Soviets found they could negotiate readjustments or compel surrender terms by fiat. Moreover, the fact that these countries' governments were part of the Axis provided a justification for Soviet replacement by a friendlier government. The global nature of communism meant there were always a ready cadre of communist exiles who could follow in the wake of the Red Army and act as a new provisional government that would toe the line from Moscow. Finland avoided this fate by being among the first Axis powers to make a deal with the Soviets and thus got a fair number of political concessions, but the ceded geographic territories were the price to pay for these concessions.  The other reason, and one that arguably had the greater impact, was that the Red Army was strong enough to pretty much impose these borders by force if necessary. The Soviets had boots on the ground in Eastern Europe and Anglo-American diplomats knew this. Negotiations at Yalta and later Potsdam were tense, but there was realistic assessment that Eastern Europe was a region of the world where the Soviets already had a preponderance of military power. Short of war, there was relatively little that the Anglo-Americans could do to rectify this situation. The Anglo-American dilemma was that in order to keep Stalin involved in diplomacy for both the war against Japan and the postwar period, they had to sate his immediate territorial demands.   The Anglo-American response to Soviet territorial aggrandizement has attracted more than its fair share of critics both at the time and since. Notions of the ""betrayal at Yalta"" were quite common in Eastern European emigre groups as well as various anticommunist ideologues during the Cold War. While some of this critique has a point, the postwar Soviet occupation led to dictatorships, it can go too far.  The Anglo-French alliance may have went to war in 1939 in response to Germany's invasion of Poland, but they did not go to war *for* Poland.  The Polish alliance was more about drawing a line against Hitler's expansionism than it was about protecting the rights of Poland. This was emblematic of the fact that Eastern Europe lay very low on the list of priorities for Anglo-American diplomats and leaders. Not only had their participation in the Axis cost them in terms of prestige, there was a sense among some Anglo-American opinion that Eastern Europe was the natural geographic sphere of influence for Soviet power. One example of this was that the emigre former head of the Russian 1917 Provisional Government Alexander Kerensky actually argued in editorials and letters in 1944/45 that Soviet aggrandizement in the Baltic was a natural redress of the First World War. Even though Kerensky was no fan of either Stalin or the USSR, he was a proponent of expansion. So charges of betrayal often project a sympathy for Eastern Europe that just was not present among Anglo-American leaders.   The other problem with the betrayal charge was that there was no real viable option to dislodge the Soviets from Eastern Europe to restore the 1939 borders. Stalin knew the Red Army gave him a valuable card and he pushed his advantage. Refusing to acknowledge these borders was a quixotic task and could lead to a darker road of a renewed war. Such a prospect was not one any Anglo-American leader relished and even the least-worst option of diplomatic isolation had the potential to spiral into another conflict. "	human

555	I'll chime in a bit with regards to fashions in high medieval Europe (1000-1200, approximately). It's largely the same song and dance, but substitute a linen tunic of variable length for the shirt and shift. Men wore baggy linen shorts, tied off at the waist, to which long woolen or linen hose were attached. Unless a person had stripped to the waist, as when doing heavy labor, the shorts probably would not have been visible.  Outer garments tended to be made of wool. The dominant garment for both men and women, the mainstay of any wardrobe, was a tunic (or kyrtle, or bliaut) of knee to ankle length, fitted or loose, as dictated by the fashion of the day. Woolen cloaks were worn atop these.  So, we're dealing with the same materials worn in about the same order. Sadly, I have no idea how often medieval people washed their clothing - the sources just aren't there - but the linen undergarments would seem suited to frequent washing.	human
556	"Not necessarily, or perhaps, not in the twelfth century when Benjamin is writing. For this we have to look not to the centuries of Islamic rule under the Umayyads and the early ta'ifa kingdoms but specifically to the Almohad dynasty that rules Islamic Iberia during Benjamin's lifetime.  The Almohads, like the Almoravids before them, came to power first in North Africa as a deeply, zealously *Islamic* Berber ruling dynasty. They swept into the relative anarchy of the little ""taifa"" kingdomlets in southern Iberia and solidified their hold militarily--and religiously.  The Almohads were determined to create and maintain a *Muslim* society, which first of all meant making sure that Muslims themselves adhered to strict standards of faith and practice.   Secondarily (both in terms of time and in terms of motivation/attention), they focused on non-Muslim natives of their territory. Jews and Christians in al-Andalus and North Africa found themselves subject to economic and physical coercion to convert or emigrate. (The Almohads had no trouble hiring non-Muslims mercenaries from *outside* their borders to fight in their armies, of course! Just, the people who actually lived there). At the same time, Christian rulers sweeping south across Iberia were quite eager to invite Jews to come populate the sparsely-settled interior peninsula, especially with Jewish money and knowledge of how to cultivate/manage the Mediterranean climate land. So one of the patterns scholars identify is that by the time of final Christian conquest of the south, there were basically no Christians or Jews left living in the last pieces of Islamic territory.  For Benjamin extrapolating backwards from his present circumstances, then, Islamic rule in Iberia and across the Pyrenees was not an ""ornament of the world"" of *convivencia*, even if Christian rule was also less than ideal."	human

After that battle, the British/French/Belgians and the Germans were in a constant race to outflank each other in what would come to be known as the [Race to the Sea](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Race_to_the_Sea_1914.png). It was during this one month period (from the end of September to the end of October) that the notorious trench system was established on the Western Front.  During the Race to the Sea, one side would make a move to outflank the other by several miles. They would then dig in, with the troops digging the trenches. With their northern (right) flank now exposed, the other side would do the same thing, and dig in not far from the new positions of the first side. Fighting would normally commence after each side had dug in, which is how battles such as [Albert (1914)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Albert_(1914)), [Arras (1914)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arras_(1914)), [La Bassée](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_La_Bassée), and [Ypres (1914)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Ypres) came about.

561	Yeah. Communication was awful, particularly when armies were on the move. Once things stabilized it became a bit easier, but never before had these commanders managed formations of that size and of that concentration.   And artillery and infantry basically acted independent of one another, as we've seen. It took four years to figure out how to coordinate the two effectively like what we see at battles like Vimy Ridge and in 1918. 	human

567	Whould you please elaborate the word ‘invade’ ?   How can there be an invasion , if all the state councils agreed to help for the War of Salvation and in additionally, also agreeing to the Republic of Turkey’s  national border during congress meetings before the war?   What I can only see is after the War of Salvation and the establishment of 1st Council of Republic Turkey , there are uprisings and assasination attempts made by nationalists with their only claim to the soils and their autonomy. However,  both of these things really had promised to them because of Sevr agreement and the corresponding Nations’ will. They didnt fought for their autonomy diplomatically and definitely not represented themselves as a country, unlike R.o.T. during those years.   I believe these kind of thinking doesnt provide any claim to the natural borders of Republic of Turkey. It is not enough. In my opinion , people died to keep ‘that’ nation as a whole, never minding their national differences because it was never the big picture, the big picture has always been living under the same safe roof without invasions of emperialist nations and their underling’s provocative guerilla tactics and empty, unreinforced ideologies. If people died for their nations interests and saying and teaching things like Mustafa Kemal invaded our homelands, I think they just want to take advantage of all the loss and desperate situations The Republic of Turkey had gone through during establishment years.  The ideology of seperationism likes to think that a country born out of poverty has enough resources and man power to invade additional soil.  That ideology has resurfaced because of governments wrong doings after Mustafa Kemal’s death and equally responsive and equally unjustified actions of guerilla groups from southeast.	human

569	"Modified from [an earlier answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistoriahttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7u0mtl/german_unification_question/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=AskHistoriansns/comments/67istq/had_bismarck_always_been_a_strong_nationalist_did/)  One anecdote about Bismarck was that when someone asked him about the possibility of Austria joining the newly minted German state, the Chancellor declared he would declare war on Austria to prevent such a union. Not only does this anecdote convey Bismarck's dark and sarcastic wit, it also underscores the complicated nature of German national unity. While Bismarck did certainly assert the unification of Germany was Prussia's destiny, what exactly constituted ""Germany"" was more plastic in Bismarck's formulations.   It is important to note that Bismarck did not invent German nationalism or debates on national unification, but rather was a player in a complex political process. Broadly speaking, the debate over unification in the first half of the nineteenth century  ranged between two poles called  *Kleindeutschland* (lesser Germany) and *Großdeutschland* (greater Germany) solutions.  In general, the *Kleindeutsch* position stressed that Germany should unify as a political entity consisting of the core German states. These central European states were allegedly ethnically and linguistically homogeneous (on the ground, the various German states were *far* more diverse, but nationalist activists often overlooked this).  The partisans of *Großdeutschland* argued for a larger expansion of Germany into regions where there were large German minorities like Bohemia. The political conditions in Europe in the mid-nineteenth century tended to favor the *Kleindeutsch* solution. Incorporating Austria into a future German state would have meant adulterating this new German polity because in addition to Austrian Germans, the Austrian Empire contained many Slavs and other non-Germans. One of the big sticking points of the *Paulskirche* debates about German unification in 1848 was whether the Austria empire could be incorporated into a new German union given the size of its non-German population in places like Bohemia. The only real practical solution to this impasse would have been a real or de facto dissolution of the Austrian empire, which the Habsburg emperor would not permit. Therefore *Großdeutschland* or pan-German activists in the nineteenth century often saw the old imperial house as a barrier to their aspirations to unite the whole German cultural sphere.   Bismarck favored the *Kleindeutsch* parties not only for practical reasons- it was the more manageable position and the one with the greatest political support- but also because it aligned within his own biases. As a staunch Lutheran, Bismarck was leery of incorporating too many Catholics into a Prussian-dominated polity. One of Bismarck's schemes during the Crimean War was a proposal that Austria and Prussia divide up Central Europe along the [Main River](http://riverboatratings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Rhine-and-Main-Rivers.jpg) leaving Prussia with the mostly Protestant northern half of the German Confederation. While this proposal went nowhere, it does speak to Bismarck's initial reluctance to include sizable numbers of Catholic Germans under Prussian control. Even though Luther was very distant history in the nineteenth century, the Protestant German cultural milieu had a strong streak of anti-Catholic prejudices and many Protestant ideologues associated Catholicism with retrograde thinking and ultramontainism. Bismarck's public rhetoric both before and after unification played up on these Protestant stereotypes of Catholics' backwardness and Protestant modernity. One of his more common phrases likened Catholic Austria to ""a  worm-eaten galleon"" compared to the ""trim Prussian frigate,"" which was an image that played on notions of the modernity of German Protestants and a Catholic power trapped in the past. While Bismarck did allow southern Germany to join in the German union, he was incredibly leery of Catholic politicians like Windthorst and the Zentrum, the Catholic party, was one of Bismarck's initial opponents in the Reichstag.   Although the process and experience unification lessened confessional differences over the long-term, these were not minor demographic challenges in the 1860s. The political system in Prussia was already rigged against Catholic political mobilization and the presence of Catholics in the post-1871 political order was a disruption to the political system. Incorporating the Austria, even if just Cisleithania or areas like the Sudetenland would introduce a confessional balance favoring Catholics that neither Bismarck nor many of his contemporaries would have been comfortable dealing with. Bismarck's experience with the Zentrum in the early decades of the *Kaiserreich* did show him that a Catholic minority was a difficult proposition, so incorporating more Catholics would have been a dead letter. By tacking to a *Kleindeutschland* position in the 1860s-70s, Bismarck became the champion of a type of German nationalism, even though the imperial structure he created privileged Prussia and the Hohenzollerns. For Bismarck, Prussian nationalism *was* the nationalism of *Kaiserreich*; he saw the two as complimentary, not as fundamentally oppositional.   Added to the domestic complexities of confession, pushing for an Austro-German union was also a bridge too far in terms of international *Realpolitik*. While Bismarck could corral the lesser German princes to accept the authority of the Hohenzollerns, he could not apply the same mixture of veiled threats and inducements to a great imperial house like the Habsburgs. The monarchs of Third Germany had actual incentives to join Bismarck's union whether through the carrot of promises of continued relevance in the federal structure as subordinates to the Hohenzollerns or the latent stick of dissolution like the Hanoverians. Neither approach was viable for the Habsburgs. Nor was simply deposing the Habsburgs a practical possibility either since that begged the question what to do about the rest of the Austrian empire. Leaving Hungary and the Balkans up to their own devices invited trouble with the Russian empire filling in the vacuum. The Wars of German unification had already disrupted the European balance of power. Removing Austria from this balance for a *Großdeutschland* would have been a leap into a very dangerous unknown.   In the end, Bismarck did not really have a terribly coherent vision of where Austria fit within his post-1871 system. While it was clear that he wold fight tooth-and-nail against the incorporation of the ""worm-eaten galleon"" into his frigate, he had little idea of where Austria would go after the end of the German Confederation. Some of his writings and speeches indicated that he hoped the Habsburgs would reform along German lines to become more modern after their defeat in 1866, but Bismarck's alliance system was predicated on Habsburg subordination to Berlin. The nationalist rhetoric inside Germany that celebrated Wilhelm I's unification of Germany, a cult of personality Bismarck certainly encouraged, undermined the domestic position of Franz Joseph as pan-Germanists in Cisleithania often incorporated this material to the detriment of their loyalty to the Habsburgs. While both international circumstances and domestic considerations precluded any serious *Großdeutsch* policies by Bismarck, the option remained on the table and would survive the wreckage of both the Hohenzollern and Habsburg dynasties in 1918.   *Sources*  Pflanze, Otto. *Bismarck and the Development of Germany 1*.

573	"This is a topic discussed by Henry Petroski, who has written several books on the history of design and engineering, in several of his books but most extensively in *The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance* where it's discussed in the context of why this layout has become ubiquitous and how the same factors continue today despite the existence of ""better"" keyboard layouts, specifically the Dvorak.  The origin of the QWERTY keyboard in the late 1870s was indeed to reduce the incidence of jams in contemporary typewriters, not by slowing the action of the typist, but by physically separating the most commonly used keys. Mechanical typewriter keys have a direct physical linkage to the letter being typed, and the action of pressing the key provide the power to swing the letter forward and stamp on the paper. By laying out the keyboard such that common letter combinations, e.g. ""S-T"", don't involve adjacent letters, it's less likely for a jam to occur in normal typing. This design constraint, combined with the need to still make the most common keys easily accessible (there's a reason why ""Q"" and ""Z"" are off in the corners, for example), led to the QWERTY layout as a solution.  As to the rest of your question, I highly recommend reading the book as it's a surprising complicated story involving not just the ergonomics and utility of the design for users but also the interaction with other technology and even the economy of the day.

578	It's a little.. misleading to call it desertion. The original wording from Carpini's description of the Mongol army was:  &gt;When the line goes into battle, if one or two or three or more flee from the squad of ten, all ten are killed; and if all ten flee, unless the rest of the hundred flee, all of them are killed. Briefly, unless they give way together, all who flee are killed. Also, if one or two or more proceed daringly into the fight and the remainder of the ten do not follow, they are killed; and if one or more of the ten is captured and the other comrades do not free them, again they are killed.  It's not so much about desertion as it was about the units working and moving together. The false retreat, a tactic where the army feigns retreat, hoping the enemy pursues in a more broken/vulnerable formation so that they can counter attack was a steppe favorite, but it only works if well coordinated. The punishment for not fleeing (when others were fleeing) was just as severe as when you fled on your own.	human
579	So, interestingly, it actually was able to defend itself right up until the end. The Roman army of the fifth century retained its ability to find success in large battles. Some examples are Stilicho's defeat of the massive Goth army, led by Radagaisus, in 405. Constantius defeated Gerontius and the usurper Constantine III, in around 410. As late as 451, a mere 25 years before the final Roman emperor in Italy would be deposed, the Roman general Aetius won a massive victory over Attila the Hun. Majorian defeated the Visigoths in 458. So the western Roman armies were still having major successes against their enemies in large and significant battles.  Also, many of Rome's losses and defeats in this period were from deceit and trickery, or largely uncontested invasions. For example, Alaric's sieges and eventual sacking of Rome which occurred from 408 to 410, went largely unopposed militarily, due to the recent execution of the preeminent western general, Stilicho. The 406 invasions across the Rhine, which would carry barbarian groups all the way through Gaul, Hispania, and across North Africa, went mostly uncontested by major armies. The invaders would have encountered the *limitanei*, the border forces, but those did not have the numbers to stop major invasions. When these invasions were contested by the larger field armies, they were slowed and halted, such as when forces reinforced Carthage and forced the Vandals to agree to remain in Numidia - but that didn't last long! The major defeat at Cap Bon in 468, was a naval defeat brought about through deceit, not an actual engagement between armies.   So, overall, the late Roman army was still very effective. But how could an Empire have an effective army and still collapse? If you're asking that question, have a look at the faq and the profiles of some of the flairs who have answered questions there, there are some very good write ups about how the Empire didn't really **collapse**. It was more of a slow dissolution and change, where the provinces slowly but steadily grew more distant from the imperial center, eventually to a point where we consider them separate. There was no major and decisive battle that defeated the Empire. In fact, it was an element of the Roman army that deposed the last Roman emperor in Italy in 476, and appointed one of their own as king instead. The other elements of the army were absorbed into the successor kingdoms or created their own successor state, such as the Kingdom of Soissons.	human

585	Also, the Siege of Pittsburgh during the American Civil War is relevant.   Older battles such as The Battle Of The Trench(hundred years war) may have involved trenches, but it was the ability of the rifled musket and later, rifles themselves, that changed the character of warfare.     Prior to the Minie bullet, musket warfare was still fought at close distances, and the ability of infantry in fortified positions was greatly reduced.   The rifled musket had an effective range of 200yds, and a skilled rifleman could shoot out to 350 or 400 with a great degree of accuracy.  The American Civil War is of particular significance due to the Napoleonic style tactics utilized at it's onset, as is seen at the battle of First Manassas.  By the Pittsburgh campaign, things had definitely changed.    The Pittsburgh campaign also feature a massive mine dug underneath the opposing trenches and detonated, Something that was also attempted in WW1. 	human

587	"Honestly? Most of them, at least as far as the European Middle Ages are concerned. We hear about the big splashy successful sieges, but that's mostly because siege warfare was almost always a *military* failure for the attacking side. The logistics and realities of a siege heavily favored defendants in most cases. Fortresses (castles or fortified parts of towns) stocked up on food supplies, but often were able to trade even with enemy soldiers looking to make some quick money for extra food. And it wasn't just the defenders who had to feed themselves! The besieging army had to eat off the surrounding land, probably filled with hostile people, and certainly less likely to be planted again once plundered.  Furthermore, castle defenses were generally pretty good and frequently improved. Cologne in 1206 was indeed besieged and sacked. What was the immediate reaction? Rebuild the defenses and make them even stronger, so it wouldn't happen again. Even the introduction of gunpowder weaponry to a defensive system established for hurtled projectiles was no guarantee. It took 1514 large cannonballs to break down Maastricht's defenses in a lengthy campaign over 1407-08; in 1480, besiegers of Rhodes expended *3800* cannonballs in their attempt. Defenders learned to build second walls, to build earthwork supports behind stone walls. In fact, apparently a lot of victories over castles and towns in the early gunpowder years came about through intimidation rather than actual strength! The only ""pregnable"" thing was people's emotions.  Again, this is not to say that cities and castles *never* fell, and definitely not to undercut the utter devastation wrought by sackers and conquerors. However, numerically speaking, being the offensive party in a siege campaign was far more often a losing proposition on the military field. Its primary power was through intimidation and coercion to negotiate--a power that the occasional victory certainly did very much to reinforce."	human
588	"I'm gonna be super lazy and quote right from the essay: *Aside from book learning, toys and games were intended to train the young for adult life. Giovanni Dominici did not approve of the 'little wooden horses, attractive cymbals, imitation birds, gilded drums, and a thousand different kind of toys' which too many parents gave their children. Instead, he advised mothers to build 'a little altar or two in the house', encouraging their daughters to adorn the chapel with garlands of flowers and greenery and their sons to dress themselves in coloured vestments [to] 'play at saying Mass.'* [Dominici (1927b) pp.113 117: 'cavalluci di legno, vaghi cembali, uccellini contraffatti, dorati tamburelli, e mille differenze di giocucci ... uno altaruzzo o due in casa ... parinisi a dir messa'; Dominici (1927a, pp. 42-5)] *Dominici's aim was to guide the impressionable young toward a pious, preferably clerical or monastic life.*   It's completely fascinating to me and I think I need to look into the sources she cites -- it's impossible for me to read about play-pretend liturgy without thinking of Smerdyakov from *Brothers Karamazov* performing fake funerals for cats, and also my own childhood obsession with telling people ""please be seated"".

In the long tradition of the Call of Duty games, the historical accuracy that is advertised is that of what the medium of the video game can most faitful re-create: Objects, and in particular weapons. One of the biggest selling points of the early Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games was the faithful re-creation of WWII weaponry and in particular, its sound. So, while in those games you go and blow up a dam completely by yourself, your MP-40 sure sounded like an actual MP 40 sounded like.  This is, at least partly, understandable given the specifics and limitations of the medium: Back when those games were popular and also with regard to Kingdom Come, the recreation of fighting styles, swords, or machine guns on an audiovisual level or regarding certain physics mechanics is a huge strength of the medium itself.  At the same time because these games are also media products created with the intention of selling a product to a consumer base as large as possible, their depictions of history more often than not are not informed by historical research on the period in question but on recognizable and popular images and media products that also depict the period. I have gone into this with regard to WWII in [this answer on why there are no FPSs representing the German perspective of WWII](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7hjtw5/can_anyone_help_me_understand_why_games_like_cod/) and the gist of it is that the WWII of FPS especially is the WWII of Saving Private Ryan and Enemy at the Gates, not the WWII as it is researched in actual scholarship, especially when it comes to the portrayal not of historical minutae like weapons but to the portrayal of the actual historical understanding of the world and the outlook and feelings of the people that lived in this world.  This, it can be argue, is because of the reason that they can't. As products geared towards entertainment in order to sell something, to re-create the experience of the common folk in the medieval and early modern period as described by The Return of Martin Guerre or The Worms and the Cheese is impossible for a video game for to deep dive into the theological understanding of the world of a 16th century Italian miller is certainly entertaining to read as a scholarship but it wouldn't make for entertaining video game playing.  Thus, historical video games are never historically accurate. They can't be for while the world of past people is approachable to us via scholarship and description, it cannot be played for experiencing it is too far removed from any tangible mechanic that can be ""playified"". Thus, what historical video games do is to shroud themselves in historical authenticity rather than accuracy. Authenticity is different from accuracy in that the former represents in lockstep with [cultural collective memory](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6v1yj5/monday_methods_collective_memory_or_lets_talk/) what feels right about a specific past rather than necessarily what really transpired in said past. What actually occurred on D-Day for many of its participants might not align with what we have before our mind's eyes. We see Saving Private Ryan and Omaha, not the landing at Gold or Utah. We see a ""greatest generation"" narrative about how average Joe from small town USA takes up arms to defend liberty and freedom akin to Saving Private Ryan where Tom Hanks' character background as a schoolteacher that coaches the baseball team and is afraid his wife won't recognize him anymore essentially serves to enforce this narrative; not necessarily the messy and terrible experience actual war veteran Jospeh Heller describes in Catch 22 or that is captured by such excellent pieces of scholarship such as Susan L. Carruther *The Good Occupation*.  That is also why we see the middle ages and also other periods of history – /u/Bernardito has written excellently about WWI in this regard – as what Bernardito accurate described as ""mythic white spaces"", meaning that in terms of pop-cultural representation what our collective pop-cultural memory dictates is that these spaces can and must be only inhabited by what we today perceive as white people in order to feel ""authentic"" to us.  This is also why the ""historical accuracy"" argument is employed very selectively: It stands out as a positive when it comes to the recreation of objects, it is used as a defense against the inclusion of black people or female characters. It is not applied to the story of a blacksmith defining the future of Bohemia, which according to Kingdom Come's website is the set-up of the game or to a myriad of other details where the developers had to compromise historical representation with game mechanics in that e.g. I'm pretty sure the player character can't be bitten by a rat to die of a horrible disease wasting away for months.  In the end what it comes down to is this: Would it be historically accurate, as in backed up by scholarship on the period, to find black people in Medieval Europe? Yes, it would as above linked discussion. But since video games can by design never be fully historically accurate, it can only be about the perceived historical authenticity of a historical period in pop-cultural representation and there the wish for a more diverse cast of people is absolutely justified too – both by history as well as challenging common tropes about certain pasts and their pop-cultural representations.   And even if, one could argue, it is just a silly piece of media that has nothing to do with current cultural forces, then too nothing stands in the way of having black NPCs and female characters. If it is nothing more than historically inspired fantasy without wider implications then too a developer is free to include black, brown, female and Asian characters to their hearts delight.  The only place an opposition to the inclusion of black people and women can arguably come from is because developers and customers don't want black people in their games – and that has, to me, some highly questionable implications."	human

All the drawings you see of civil war battlefields are textbook Jomini. The advantage that Jomini has over Clausewitz is that he is easy to understand. While both focus on Napoleon as the source of their theory, Jomini is really the most distilled “for dummies” version. Clausewitz at the time of the American civil war was still most widely read in Prussia. While Jomini dominated elsewhere. I’m in a class about strategy right now and we read Clausewitz, but only briefly discussed Jomini. Now, he’s seen as outdated while some of Clausewitz’s theories are very strong still.	human
594	"This is bang on. Accounts of sieges from the first half of the 15th century make it really clear just how difficult it was to take a fortified strong point by storm. For example if you look at the siege of St. Denis in 1435 the walls and gates were ""greatly damaged by the English cannon in so many places that their captains resolved to make several attacks on the town at the same time, with the hope of gaining it by storm"".  The result? The English ""perceived they could not carry their point without too serious a loss"". Whilst all this caused the defenders to become ""much alarmed"" the actual catalyst for their surrender was that they learned that they wouldn't be reinforced.  This wasn't a small investment either - all sources make clear that the siege of St. Denis was a major operation (it was the last major engagement of the Anglo-Burgundian alliance). Even when everything seemed to line up for the attackers it was, as you said, negotiation that ended the siege.  All quotes from Monstrelet, Book 7."	human
595	"In general, Irving has a two-pronged approach both in his writings and his public persona (lectures, web posts, interviews, etc.) towards survivors.   The first prong of his approach, and one more common in his books, is to selectively focus on aspects of Nazi genocide that do not deal with its victims. Irving famously in *Hitler's War* focused on the lack of a *Führerbefehl* or other personal documentation tying Hitler directly to the camps or other massacres. For example, he notes that neither Heydrich nor Himmler directly reported to Hitler on the activities of the *Einsatzgruppen* in the USSR, therefore Hitler must have been in the dark. Likewise, Irving maintains a literal interpretation of the Wannsee Conference's [minutes](http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/Wannsee/wanseeminutes.html) which he avers "" sanctioned the evacuation of all Jews to the eastern territories, substituting this for the overseas deportation originally planned (Madagascar). In the east the Jews would build roads until they dropped. This, and no more, is all that the much-mentioned Wannsee conference protocols reveal; there was no talk of murder.""   Such literalism is obtuse in the extreme. The Madagascar plan or use of Jewish corvee labor were not non-violent means of dealing with the Jewish problem, but tentative steps to genocide either through working Jews to death or exiling them to islands that could not support such numbers. But this is a method used by Irving to set the parameters of the debate on ground of his choosing. Irving uses surviving archival data as a shield, claiming that emotions are so heated around this topic and there are so many self-parties like Israeli Zionists that allegedly passionless archival evidence is the solution. Irving though wants things both ways. He liberally interprets documents to suit his purposes, as with the Wannsee protocols, but always on his terms. And despite his disdain for eye-witnesses, he freely uses reminiscences of various adjutants or minor officials alleging that they had no axes to grind. Again, the unspoken implication in his books is that survivors *do* have axes to grind and are often the tools of self-interested parties like Zionists in Israel.   The second prong of Irving's stratagem for survivors is to engage in all sorts of rather disgusting personal attacks on their motivations and writings. Irving is on record for dismissing Primo Levi's *If this is a Man* in the newspaper *The Independent* as the rantings of a ""mentally unstable Jew"" and his books were published for money by money-hungry publishers. His non-IHR website has an [entry](http://www.fpp.co.uk/Auschwitz/Wiesel/) on Elie Wiesel salaciously notes in a caption ""Speaking fee: $25,000 per lecture plus chauffeur-driven car"" along with links to people claiming Wiesel has falsely claimed a different identity or that *Night*'s details do not match up with the historical record.   The transcripts from the [Lippstadt trial](https://www.hdot.org/trial-materials/trial-transcripts/) reveal another method he uses. At various points he notes that eyewitness' accounts do not match or were absent in aerial photographs of the sites. This focus on niggling details- the remembered color of crematoria smoke is wrong, therefore the account is in question- is of a piece with his written works' selective use of evidence. Irving tries to set the goalposts in such a way that things appear more muddled and his position is more reasonable.   The problem with this trickery was that Irving was up against people who were much smarter than him in the libel trial. Squaring archival accounts with patchy eyewitness testimony is basic historical method and Irving's strategy of dismissal would not fly with someone of Christopher Browning's caliber or the judges in the case. As Justice Gray noted on Day 17 of the trial after Irving rambled on in cross-examination of Browning on the veracity of affidavits and testimony produced in postwar trials:  &gt;Mr Irving, I do not want to interrupt you unduly. I am not finding this terribly helpful because we  all know that eyewitness evidence has to be looked at very carefully. Everyone agrees on that.  This exchange was part of the reason why Irving emerged from the libel trial in tatters.   Overall, Irving's two-prongs with regards to witnesses- either dismiss them as irrelevant or question their motives- is a disgusting sham posing as intellectual inquiry. It is hypocritical of Irving in the extreme to use unsourced claims of Wiesel's speaking fees when he himself arrives at Denialist conventions with the same perks and his webpages are filled with solicitations for more money. He also engaged in antisemitic tropes of greedy, dissembling Jews who will do anything for Mammon. He is smart enough not to go too far in his invective. It is not Jews  Irving claims he has a problem with, but individuals who are Jews. But using this antisemitic imagery makes him little different than a typical Stormfront poster.   In the end, David Irving is slime and I feel dirty for poking around his corpus of work.   "	human
596	The Vikings aren't feared because they're Pagan, but because they're competent raiders and invaders who posed a genuine threat to the safety of the kingdom. Their Paganism *is*, however a useful rhetorical tool for the English and Frankish authors who write about them and who want to exhort their audiences to resist them. Paganism isn't scary because it's somehow superior, but because it represents the antithesis of Christian order and society.   Pagans are often used as a literary device as representatives of divine retribution - God is displeased with how a society is taking care of things so he sends the Barbarians to burn it all down. For Gildas, the arrival of the Pagan Anglo-Saxons in the 5th Century was the result of the sins and complacency of the Romano-British. For the chroniclers of the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*, the attack on Lindesfarne is punishment for the same sins in the English. Asser implies strongly that Alfred's triumph over the Great Army is as much a result of his fervent Christian reformism as it is his governmental reforms or military leadership. Archbishop Wulfstan's famous *Sermon of the Wolf to the English* castigates the current generation of the English for their greed, lawlessness, cowardice and immorality, concluding that it is no wonder that the Vikings are able to be so succesfully maraud, as compared to their victorious forefathers, this generation is unworthy of victory. The Magyars who ravage over much of central Europe and Francia in the ninth and early tenth century are defeated in Regino of Prüm's history by the religious devotion and discipline of the Ottonian Emperors. Adam of Bremen chronicles the Vikings of Uppsala in fantastical terms, borrowing heavily from Pliny. In this account, the Pagans aren't scary so much as they are bizarre. Thietmar of Merseburg writes with a surprising level of detail and understanding about the Pagan practices of the Wends, but still writes of the Pagan Wendish uprising following Otto II's defeat at the Battle of Stilo as a form of retribution for Otto's failure to properly bring the Wends into Christendom.  The Vikings *are* feared because they're accomplished raiders. Their reputation as unstoppable warriors comes largely from their effective strategy of largely targeting undefended or poorly defended sites, which they could quickly overwhelm. Their tactics, portrayed in the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*, illustrate how they actually avoided pitched battle as much as possible, opting for a war of movement targeting monasteries and settlements and trying to pick of garrisons piecemeal to sow terror and division. When the Great Army is actually matched in pitched battle, particularly against Wessex, it's record is about 50-50 and the Vikings actually lose far more engagements than they win.	human
597	"First of all, please recognize that the term ""Native Americans"" refers to members of a variety of cultures extending from the southern tip of South America to the Arctic rim. These cultures were and are incredibly diverse in their customs and practices. They range from city dwelling agriculturists to  unspecialized hunters and gatherers. It is therefore clearly impossible to make generalizations about such an enormous and varied population.  I specialize in Pacific Northwest and Inter-mountain West groups (from NW California to southern Alaska), so I can tell you a little about some of them. But even among these groups there is an enormous range of variability in celebrations and recognitions of life stage events and the practices may relate to social class so they may vary by class. One thing they hold in common, is that there were none focused on an individual that occurred on an annual basis. So the answer in my area, to the best of my knowledge, about Birthdays is no.  Some examples of life events that were and are recognized in elaborate rituals and very strict conventions in the NW include: rites of puberty, celebrations of same (Hupa, Yurok, Karuk), time of naming (many, many groups in the NW had these), ear piercing of noble children (Tsimshian, Tlingit, and other far North groups), inheritance of the responsibilities of uncle (Matrilinial and Matrilocal groups of the far North), marriage (most groups), and time of death/burial (virtually everyone in the NW).  There were celebrations/ornate rituals that took place on an annual or biannual basis, but they did not focus on individuals. Examples of these include the ""world renewal ceremonies"" of peoples in the south like the white deerskin dance and jump dance of far NW California.

601	   There are two main parts that come to mind when I think of the animals in the games. One was when one performer would hunt the animal (mostly exotic and dangerous) for a scene or sport and kill it. But the other part mainly was feeding Christians and prisoners to them, (who were most of the time already in bad shape). I am sure here and there a gladiator would fight one. Anything to keep the crowds coming. Many animals were killed, a lot of them endangered and exotic to keep Romans entertained.

Sevres was replaced by Treaty of Lausanne which sealed Turkey's eastern border not only against a potential Kurdistan but for a Greater Armenia as well.  Then we have to consider the Sykes-Picot agreement between British Iraq and French Syria which created borders without putting into consideration the vibrant ethnic and religious diversity in both countries. (I.e. Armenians, Assyrians, Alewites, Kurds, Turkmen, Druze, Shia/Sunni divide, etc.)  The Kurds were too divided amongst each other for the colonial powers to help a carve an ethnic state for them so they were sort of ""forgotten"" even though they themselves did not forget their identity and refused to integrate into whatever country they lived in.

614	"Exactly. The premise itself is pretty much incorrect. Race is a social construct, which doesn't actually exist in the physical world. The idea of race as more than a cultural concept is pretty much rejected scientifically. Here's the American Anthropological Association's [statement on race](http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583).  America's last President had a ""white"" mother and a ""black"" father and was raised by his ""white"" grandparents in Hawaii. Yet he is considered to be black. Why? Racism, which resulted in the concept of [hypodescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule#Twentieth_century).   What makes someone whose genetic heritage is 1/8 African a ""black""? Nothing, other than the  ""one-drop"" rule which has absolutely no bearing in science.  If you arrange humans into groups based on how they are actually related, those groups won't correspond even approximately to common notions of ""race.""  Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic ""racial"" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes. This means that there is greater variation within ""racial"" groups than between them.  In formal terms, phenotype (outward appearance) was supposed to be a good predictor of genotype (deeper biological similarities). However, today we know that phenotype is a LOUSY indicator of genotype. Worthless, in fact. Ethiopians are more closely related to certain Mediterranean Europeans than they are to Pygmies, even though both are ""black."" Australian Aborigines are as distantly related to Africans as it's possible for two living populations to be, yet they are both superficially ""black.""  DNA testing has determined genetic-relatedness. Because of their isolation, Australian Aborigines have drifted further genetically from Africans than any other set of genes. Look at Google Earth and you'll see how this occurred.  However, this geographic and temporal isolation doesn't suddenly make them a ""race"". Those genetic differences amount to 1/15th of the differences extant within any racial ""group"".   The observers who seize on these minor variables, to classify human groups, while ignoring the far more dramatic variables within groups demonstrably don't do so out of any objective desire for the ""truth.""

615	"There is a very, *very* long history of people attributing the ""fall of Rome"" to Christianity. It actually goes back to the Visigoths' sack of Rome in 410--Augustine wrote *City of God* in large part to counter accusations that Rome's Christianization had weakened the city and made it susceptible to the onslaught.  From the mid-14th century to the 16th was the height of another view. This invented the ""middle age"" between Roman literature/intellectual life and the revival of classical Latin in what would later become known as the Renaissance (literally ""rebirth""). Connected with the Reformation and Counter-Reformation topping off the era, these scholars connected the medieval Church with what they perceived as a decay of Latin and of literary quality, especially classical rhetoric.  The next major stopping point gets blamed on an immensely important and rightfully famous 18th century scholar named Edward Gibbon, although his actual view was a lot more nuanced than later commentators (still) claim. Gibbon connected the ""decline and fall of the Roman Empire"" with a decay in *morality*. This wasn't directly meant to be Christianity, but the close relationship between religion and ethics influenced later scholars to interpret it as ""Christianity killed the grandeur of Rome.""  On the heels of Gibbon came the ""Dark Ages"" narrative that is rather popular on the Internet these days. It's the view that Rome was a high point of scientific and technological progress, and the retrogressive, oppressive medieval Church was too terrified of the threat that Science posed to its theology that it stamped out any kind of technological progress for a thousand years.  Most recently, Catherine Nixey has published a polemic agitating that not Christianity in general, but zealous or fundamentalist, violent Christianity destroyed the Roman Empire.

620	Well I can speak only for the Byzantine centuries here and we will start with Nicaea in 325.  Armenia was the first state to convert to Christianity even before Constantine. They were led by their king but the actual institution of kingship was dissolved not by Rome but by the Armenian Princes requesting as such from the Persian Shah in 428.   The actual land of Armenia in the Caucasus is highly isolated. Mountains, narrow passes and occasional open land made it defensible but poor for communication and raising large quantities of manpower. The Princes of Ani, Vaspurukhan, Tao, Lori and more were courted each in turn by Constantinople as allies against first the Sassanids and then Islam because they could be common Christian allies.  There was a problem though. Armenian delegations had never been present at the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 as they were being invaded by the Sassanids (in a war to suppress Christianity) and they were uneasy about the division of Christ's Nature's into human and divine. It turned out that Byzantine and Orthodox theology were Orthodox with each other as a miaphysite agreement but all the recommunications that were declared failed quickly as Armenian Church practice was a little different too, use of unleavened bread and that sort of thing. So byzantium made use of armenian allies but they were not the utmost priority given that several Princes would ally with the Islamic powers even 30 years after Muhammad's death. (See Sebeos for this). Many individuals and families emigrated from the country for gold and military glory leading imperial armies but they did not often return and instead Byzantinised. (Charanis -Armenians in the Byzantine Empire)  So Armenia was a tug of war frontier period from 600-1050 until the Turks turned up. Later Byzantine practice from 960 was to have Armenian Lords bequeath their land to the empire but during the reign of Constantine X Doukas the armies failed and Armenia was demilitarised. Debate still wages over why and what (See Kaldellis Rivers of Blood). Armenia when it was reconstituted in Cilicia was a regional power but again limited to mountains in the Taurus.   Armenia in the late antique and medieval periods was sandwiched. It had defensibility but was not a region to control the Anatolian Plateau from and this meant that with the exception of (sometime) Armenian Edessa, wealth did not flood the Caucasus and it was a theatre of war for other, larger powers.   	human

625	Michael Psellos (c.1030-c.1080) in eleventh century Constantinople offers an amusing anecdote on this. Constantinople's Great Palace was known for possessing a room called The Hall of 19 Couches  and the imperial family and custom were still forcing people to recline like ancient Romans in the high medieval period.  Psellos, a renowned philosopher of Plato, complained of the effect of eating while lying as such causing his stomach pain and causing indigestion and flatulence, literally 'pressing the waste from my backside'.   As he makes such a note of this we can presume it was a most unusual custom to force people to do by then.  By 1081 Alexios Komnenos was emperor and he moved the family to the Blachernae Palace on the other side of the city. We may suppose the couches did not come too.	human
626	1,000 meters = 1 km  BUT!  1,000 square meters (m^2) IS NOT 1 square km (km^2).  1km^2 is 1,000,000 m^2  It's similar to how there are 12 inches in a foot but there are 144 square inches in 1 square foot.	human
627	&gt; but that's mostly because siege warfare was almost always a military failure for the attacking side. The logistics and realities of a siege heavily favored defendants in most cases.  Were they though? Well-supplied and important locations could certainly be made almost impossible to assault, but often keeping every single fortification in the countryside stocked with the number of soldiers, victuals, armor, weapons, and later guns and gunpowder, etc. necessary to survive a large-scale siege at all times could prove extremely costly for a monarch, especially if all of these resources were desperately needed for continuing the war effort elsewhere. Strongholds deemed less important might be garrisoned with only a couple dozen men to keep watch and carry out boarder raids, but if attacked by the full force of an army they might only hold out days at the most before being convinced to surrender instead of overwhelmed by storm.	human

635	While not particularly an expert on the Maya, let me try to take a shot at your question.  To respond to your question, sensationalism apart, first let me say the city that they are referring (Tikal) has been known and studied for quite a long time. The so-called game changer find is the use of new technology to speed up the process of what archaeologists called survey, allowing us to get a high-resolution map that otherwise would have taken a long time to produce. So rather than a scientific find, it is more like the use of a technology (that has been already been used for a couple of years in other archaeological sites) on a site that has the potential to yield great insights into Maya urbanism because it was one of the most important cities during the Classic period. The work is just barely beginning, and I think that people are getting caught up in the wow factor of the news, and reasonably so because of the way of how people are reporting the news.  Now, to answer your question, the Mayas of Tikal used a series of highly ingenious techniques in order to maximize the productivity output of their environment. First, in terms of agroforestry, based on archaeological charcoal remains found in middens (garbage dumps) and structures, it seems as if the Maya were micro-managing the forest by harvesting mature trees for construction or fuel purposes thus letting the younger trees reach maturity. This would have allow then to maintain a level of healthy forest along with all the resources that come with that, including animal protein and wild plants.  Second, agriculturally speaking, it seems as if Tikal Mayas were using a system of orchard-like garden agriculture along with a very meticulously managed short fallow system for their main crops, maize, squash, and beans. Not it is often assume that this were the only plants that were being cultivated, but upon closer look at seeds, phytoliths, core samples, and macro-botanical remains, we can see a great deal of fruit trees including coyul, sapote, jocote, avocado, and cacao. Furthermore, while not particularly identified at Tikal, Mayas in adjacent areas were also intensively cultivating root crops including sweet potato, achira, and malanga. Thus it is very likely that Tikal Mayas were also cultivating them along with the already mentioned crops.  While some people have suggested that a short-fallow system could not have been sustainable to maintain high levels of yield productions, sediment evidence suggest that people at Tikal were artificially inflating soil nutrients by regularly depositing volcanic ash. This constant deposition of ash would have helped them maintain intensive framing practices for extended periods.  The Mayas at Tikal also created complex water managements systems that included canals to channel the water into great man made reservoirs like the Perdido Reservoir or the Temple reservoir that could have allows them to double-cropped areas adjacent the bodies of water allowing them to obtain a second harvest.  Finally, the question of trade is always brought about because according to some people staples crops could not have been traded more than 275 km based on what a person could have walked in a week. However, the nature of trade is a hot topic for debate, since we know that there were major things that were moving from and to Tikal, like all of the volcanic ash or ground stone that is coming from the mountains in the lowlands, or the shell coming from the coast. To be honest, I tend to side with the people, like Masson and Friedel (2012), that do suggest a well-developed long and short distance market system for Tikal. Now the nature of who controls, or sponsors, this trade is also very debatable, and I think that the once the LiDAR project gets to work on testing areas beyond the city center (where most of the archaeological record has actually happen), they will be on better footing of telling us more about market exchange at Tikal.

636	It's a pretty substantial number. In 1431 Philibert de Moulant 'Master and Visitor of Our (Henry VI) Artillery in France' ordered a quarry master to shape 100 balls of stone for the siege of Louviers.  If that gives you the sense of what an individual order for cannon balls was like earlier in the century. /u/sunagainstgold would need to clarify whether they were stone or iron balls at Rhodes; at Maastricht they would most likely have been stone, as at Louviers since iron balls become more common later in the period.  Deploying artillery during this period was an incredibly logistically complicated task. A good piece of evidence for this is a wide ranging commission given out in 1430 by the English crown. John Hampton was to provide carpenters, smiths, stone-cutters and ‘other artificers’ as well as labourers required to build carts for the King’s ‘great cannon’. It goes on to call for cannon stones, oxen and all their tack and food; this commission, in addition to the above, also calls for ‘’dosers, sea-coal and other requisites for the King’s ordnance’. Furthermore Hampton is empowered to impress all the necessary carts, ships, boats and all mariners and labourers necessary for transporting the artillery to France. The like commissions are also given to John Louthe and William Flemyng. It's just on a different scale to any other single commission given out in the Patent Rolls for that year.

637	"&gt; It meant to be just like history, but with something added, for it to be the main storyline.  I'm not sure if you didn't read the comment you're responding to, or just badly misunderstood it, but to reiterate:   No, video games are not attempting to be ""just like history, but with something added."" They make use of historical themes and tropes, sure, to give themselves a vaguely authentic setting, but if you wanted to play a game that was ""just like history"" it would likely result in a year or two of indecisive maneuvering, mortgaging your kingdom to replace people dying of disease before you were able to replace them, and then a brief, sharp, terrifying battle that might decide things and might not, after you put 16,000 hours into the game.   All games are fiction, full stop.   There is historical fiction that can be accurate, but novels, movies, etc. != games, in the sense that games need to be playable to be interesting. I study navies, and I have enjoyed playing naval warfare games (starting with [The Ancient Art of War at Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ancient_Art_of_War_at_Sea) in 1987, when I was 10 years old), but they are absolutely compromised for the sake of playability.   As long as you're breaking that barrier ... sure, I wouldn't be fussed about the Eiffel Tower in 16th century Bohemia, any more than I am about e.g., David Weber novels that transport 20th century West Virginia back to 16th century Germany. You're dealing with a fictional space, and demanding absolute fidelity to an imagined past that we see in any case as through a glass darkly is a fool's errand at best.   &gt; Stop taking things way to seriously and trying to apply modern race politics to a historical video game. Please just stop.  One thing that I would examine is ... why, exactly, does a call for inclusion of diverse people in a fictional space bother you quite so much? Why is that? "	human

639	A square that is 1km² has a length of 1km and the width of 1km. Imagine literally making a huge square out of 1km length toothpicks.  Now imagine filling this huge kilometer-square with much smaller meter-sized-squares. 1km is 1000 meters long so you can fit 1000 of the meter-squares next to each other to get a row. But remember, this row is only 1m high. 999 additional rows are necessary to fill the entire kilometer-square. So, in the end, you have 1000 rows each consisitng of 1000 individual meter-squares which equals 1 000 000 meter-squares (or m²).  If you want a square that is only 1000 m² large you need to go much smaller. Sadly 1000 doesn't have a nice square root (the square would have to be 31,62m x 31,62m and that's just messy) so let's just go with a nice rectangle of 50m by 20m, OK? 	human
640	The Islamic Empire did not require conquered peoples to convert. They needed money, and cities that submitted to Islamic rule but did not convert were merely taxed at a higher rate than Muslims.

However, the bronze columns that Benjamin describes--[which do exist today](https://imgur.com/a/VJSUp)--are almost certainly not from the temple. Walter Cahn and Allegra Iafrate show that Benjamin's/the local Jewish community's attribution of the columns to the Temple was part of a larger trend of identifying traces of Jerusalem/the Temple in Rome. The columns themselves attracted a number of legendary possible origins in the Middle Ages. Iafrate even describes a myth from the same time that Augustus had had the columns forged from bronze looted off of Cleopatra's ships!	human

Allegra Iafrate further cites a French scholar whose work I haven't read that there was a literary trope in *Arabic* travel writing from the 9th century of two pillars in a Roman church. Does that have its roots in an existing St. John's decoration? Or was the later erection of pillars in the church a response by Christians to a trans-Mediterranean literary tradition they too were steeped in?	human
646	"How many? I mean I doubt their was a census and like you said the ideas of modern races weren't around yet. But going by what we today would consider ""brown"" or ""black"" or just non-european/middle eastern what percent of Europe its self would be non-white?"	human
647	"I don't know whether there were black people in this location at this time.  I'm willing to accept that there were, if that assertion is made by people who seem credible and knowledgeable.  And that means I'm willing to accept an argument of this form: That in the real life historical setting the game is trying to depict, black people were common enough that their exclusion from the game's setting represents a reliance upon a biased cultural narrative about the past rather than the actual past, and that creating fiction within that biased cultural narrative is, in effect, furthering both the narrative and the bias.  That seems completely fair.  But it is downright disingenuous as all get out to argue that because games take liberties with things like ""you play as a cool warrior instead of a peasant dying of consumption, which lets be honest is what you would be statistically more likely to be if you lived there back then,"" that the game can't use a ""realism"" or ""authenticity"" or ""historical accuracy"" justification for any other design choice.    ""Because your game is a game, it can't be TRULY accurate, therefore your setting is fictional and fantastical, therefore there is no legitimate reason to use historical fidelity to justify excluding dinosaurs and jedi and nekomimis in what you planned as a realistic WW2 shooter.""  No.    No one who actually cares about any sort of genre literature, game, or film would possibly think this way.  Hogwarts *isn't even real,* but it would violate the setting's integrity to include, say, an Honor Harrington crossover.  Verisimilitude is a thing."	human
648	"&gt; Verisimilitude  literally means ""the *appearance* of being true or real.""   I will ride *hard* for a Hogwarts/Harringtonverse crossover (ffs, the Harringtonverse had ""Rob S. Pierre"" as president of the Republic of Haven, and FTL communication and hyper speed transportation, let's not nitpick).   The point that's being made here is:   1) in *actual reality,* capitals like Prague in the Middle Ages were far more diverse than people think;   2) all design choices are arbitrary;  3) people think ""the Middle Ages"" are European and also ""white"" (which is a racial classification that comes into vogue in the 18th century) based on media that portray then this way;   4) media that pushed back against this narrative would be useful in presenting the messy reality of the actual past;   5) given that this is a fictional universe and that design choices are arbitrary, why not let people play the game as people who reflect who they actually are?   Again, I ask: *why are you so fussed about the idea that black people existed in Europe*? Because they undeniably did. "	human
649	"Minor correction, the game takes place in 1403, not the 1600s or 16th century.  Anyway, his/her answer was pretty solid.  Did black people exist in medieval Europe? Yes. Were they a significant population in the region where the game takes place? *No*, although during wars in an area like Bohemia you would certainly see ""non-white"" soldiers of all sorts from the east and south passing through.  But, in the end, it's like the poster said. Having a dead blacksmith's son end up becoming a knight and changing the course of the war isn't any more accurate than having a person of color or even a female soldier or two in the game.  The norm would be a very rich white male from old landed aristocracy becoming a knight, and even then that one man likely would have little to no impact on a war. In the interest of ""gameness"" they have a rags to riches story. Theoretically it's possible, but incredibly unlikely.  So, you end up with selectively defining what is accurate. They are hiding behind ""historical accuracy"" like a shield to deflect criticism, when it's not very accurate at all. Historical *authenticity* is another matter, and it's cultural and subjective. You absolutely could make the argument that having the game be ""white"" is more historically authentic than having people of color in 15th century Bohemia, and for the most part that would be correct. It's not more accurate, but it's how people depict and imagine it."	human

Rabbis (Jesus was also called this) were allowed to marry and reproduce, and the bible explicitly states that Mary Magdalene went to anoint his body when she discovered the tomb empty. That would never, ever fly unless it was family.   Also, and I cannot truly attest to these since it is not in the bonafide religious texts, there is a family ossuary in Talipot(?) that contains inscriptions such as ""Jesus, Son of Joseph"", ""Mariamene"" (only time this name is used is in reference to the Magdalene), ""Maria"", etc.. basically the whole gang with the addition of ""Judah, Son of Jesus"".

653	"I have no objections to the ""actually, it would be realistic to include black people in this setting, and unrealistic to exclude them"" argument, if its true.  And I'm no expert on the subject, so I'm willing to defer to those who are.  (Although I have to say that the rest of what you have to say makes me doubt that you saying its' true constitutes any warrant for me believing it.)  So I'm just going to focus on the parts that are relevant to me.  &gt; 2) all design choices are arbitrary;  Not actually true in the sense that you seem to think it is true.  Whether I make one design choice or another may be arbitrary at the outset, but, given that I've *already made* one or more design choices, my *further* design choices are *less* arbitrary.  Each choice affects my further choices.    I think you are aware of this.  Everyone pretty much is- to argue otherwise is to imply that, for example, ""good characterization"" isn't even a thing. ""Whether the butler did the murder"" may be an arbitrary authorial choice, but ""whether the butler did the murder given that we have characterized the butler as someone who wouldn't have done the murder"" is less so.  &gt; 5) given that this is a fictional universe and that design choices are arbitrary, why not let people play the game as people who reflect who they actually are?  Because choosing to make a setting that portrays a coherent and realistic historical moment is a valid design choice, and some people think (correctly? incorrectly? valid question!) that including black people in that setting would clash with that design choice.  And the argument that by merely choosing to make a game one has already violated the verisimilitude of the intended setting so EVERYTHING GOES now is farcical, and not at all how any creative work has ever functioned, ever, in the history of all art.  &gt; Again, I ask: why are you so fussed about the idea that black people existed in Europe? Because they undeniably did.  And if that existed in the time, place, and manner necessary for their inclusion to be realistic, that's totally valid!  The better question, perhaps, is why you keep bouncing between arguing that it would be realistic to include black people, then offering middle school level arguments that verisimilitude isn't even a thing given that the setting is inherently fictional due to the requirements of the video game genre, then implying that anyone who disagrees with the latter must be disagreeing with the former for nefarious purposes.

655	"If I am reading your question right, you seem to be asking if ""was desertion so bad that they had to implement this execution order?"" When rather it seems that the order was a preventive measure.  See, between 1200-1206 Chinggis Khan completely reorganized the Mongol tribes into the famed decimal system to break up tribal loyalties and the power of the smaller Khans. Originally this was just with the military, and then to all of the tribes. The base unit of this system was the arban, 10 men, who would fight, scout and live together. After 1206, when this was spread to all the tribes, the families of these 10 would then be responsible for providing those ten with arrows, supplies etc.  Because of this the arban would have been a very personal thing, very close ties and all that, as it was essentially designed to replace those pre-imperial tribal ties. Betraying this unit then was not just a betrayal of a unit, but people you'd come to see as friends, family, and to know that they would be punished for your desertion would be a strong incentive. Strict rules such as these helped to tie together this new set up and prevent the new nation from unraveling.  As it is, there is a shockingly small amount of desertions and betrayals among Mongol armies during this period. Medieval armies tended to be just lousy with people betraying their commanders. The Jin Dynasty suffered this dramatically in its final years, with deserters founding independent kingdoms (which were in turn swallowed up by the Mongols).  Yet, the Mongols were capable of sending generals riding hundreds of hundreds of kilometres away through foreign lands with total trust that they would return: see Jebe and Subutai's famous campaigns through the Caucasus, southern Russia and back north over the Caspian Sea before remeeting Chinggis Khan (Jebe didn't return because he died, but he if he hadn't he would have). While Chinggis was campaigning in the Khwarezmian Empire his general Mukhali continued to fight in China, gaining titles, wealth and renown and for any other medieval army that certainly would have led to him declaring his independence with his lord on the far side of Asia.  Later on in the century the princes went to war against each other, and there were rebellions, but desertion seems almost entirely unheard of. The Mongols' contemporaries remark with awe the loyalty of the Mongolian warriors, and their willingness to endure every sort of hardship (effectively every single account of the Mongols from the thirteenth century mentions this at some point.)  Does that mean no Mongol ever deserted, and that this executions were never implemented? They probably were at some point. There is absolutely no indication that this hampered a campaign, but know this: while its popular to imagine the Mongols as mindless savage barbarians, they had an incredibly sophisticated military machine, far ahead of most of their contemporaries, an astute understanding of their weaknesses, strengths and their enemies' weaknesses and strengths, and a propaganda machine/ability to spread disinformation like few others. The execution order may have been spread as a part of this to convince others of their fortitude and harshness ( ""if we're willing to do this to our soldiers, what will we do to you?"" kind of thing) or, if it did occur, I doubt the Mongols or the chroniclers from the Khanates (thinking Juvaini or Rashid al-Din, some of our most reliable and oft used sources) are just not going to mention these things.  Now that is just for desertion. Others may have more on the implementation of this order for other reasons, but I have never read anything which suggests it was every widely used, if at all. Of course, if someone has something which contradicts some of my assertions here I would love to hear it.

Certainly, no place in Europe has been untouched by the history of racism but the Czech Republic is hardly very high on the list of places associated with colonialism and slavery, etc. Would it make commercial sense? Yeah. Would it be a nice gesture? Yeah. But do they have some sort of moral obligation to do so, or at least a very strong one? I think the argument (both moral and historical) is stronger for the inclusion of, say, Roma people, or Muslims.	human

However, km^2 and m^2 are not ambiguous - it's the unit that's squared, not the value. Clearly, a square km is bigger than a square meter.

661	"There is a concept called Racial Capitalism that can answer this question. Essentially, there are enormous economic incentives, under the system of private property and capital accumulation, to inculcating  racism in a population. So, it would seem that in heavily Statified and Capitalist societies, racism is more common. You can actually see how the (soon-to-be) U.S. State imposed racism for 'productive' ends. Indentured white servants saw that they were in roughly the same position as African chattel slaves and there were several cross-racial organizing attempts. Before long there were heavy fines for interracial relationships and white servants were given muskets and free reign to shoot runaway black slaves. A few decades later, and you have 'Slave Patrols"" in the south and armed escorts for urban slaves in the north. This is one half of the origins of the modern racist policing system, the other half are Pinkerton guards, and the first 'professional police force' was created in London to dissuade strikers by a guy who cut his teach oppressing colonial Ireland. Basically, racism is the best way to distract from the class conflict.  Here's a big Harvard paper on racial capitalism: https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol126_leong.pdf  And on the origins of Policing there's a cool book called Our Enemies in Blue."	human
662	"I can't speak to Chaldean influence around the world, but they appear several thousand years after many of the burial rites of the other religious practices.  Chaldean religion, as I understand it had a Levantine religion, similar to Canaanite or Semitic religions and later converted to Assyrian or Babylonian religion, which were already established by that time, and had been for some two-thousand years.  So, we can probably rule out Chaldean influence on everyone.  However, of those, the Greeks, Romans, Hindus, Buddhists, Goths, Saxons, Druids, and many more besides are descended from the Proto-Indo-European religion which led to similar practices and rites.  Greek religion also had influence from the Near-Eastern religions such as Egyptian and Babylonian.  Abrahamic religions are descended from the Canaanite religion via the Israelite people who codified worship of a war god and take their rites from themselves and the other Near-Eastern religion.  That said, many of these other religions had next to no contact with one another after about 1000, 2000, 5000, even 10 or 15 thousand years.    It would be a mistake to attribute any currently known religion as having been the genesis of all the religious traditions of the world since some have had no contact after neolithic times.  However, certainly, there has been contact between many different cultures and religions since then across Eurasia and Northern Africa which have affected the beliefs of the people.  Similarly, over the past 500 years, Europe has contacted and converted a great number of people and their current beliefs are influenced by the Christian traditions brought by the Europeans.    Beyond that, I can't say whether or not there is a common genesis for all religion, or whether it is a ""natural"" part of human development that people all over the world developed.  In any case, religions diverged a long time before the Chaldeans.  Hell, about half of those would have never had even indirect contact with Chaldean culture."	human
663	For what it's worth, the question Martin was trying to answer has puzzled people then and since. Why did many indigenous people fully participate in the overhunting of game species while sometimes recognizing that the result would be local extinction? But instead of positing an overall psycho-social interpretation for the continent's people, Martin's critics pointed out, look at the actual *details* of specific situations.   For example, indigenous participation in the final slaughter of the buffalo is sometimes treated as a mystery. The last wild buffalo herds on the northern prairies were killed by native and Metis hunters who knew there hardly any left. But this situation makes a whole lot more sense when you realize that even knowing and mourning the diminishing buffalo herds, the hunters and their families had to feed their starving children. When you factor in the American Indian wars, the movement of desperate refugees from the wars, the American and Canadian governments disinterest or active hostility towards preserving the buffalo herds, coupled with their unwillingness to send enough aid to prevent starvation, it's not some weird mystery to be solved.   Anyway, it's been interesting to talk about this. Despite my Japanese history flair, western Canadian indigenous and environmental history is my other lifelong *thing*.	human
664	"To get away from the political soapboxing and presentism that this topic inevitably brings out, late 14th-early 15th century Bohemia was largely diverse in several ways, primarily along ethnic, religious, economic and cultural lines.   At the time the game is set, which is around the turn of the century, Bohemia was largely considered by the rest of the European powers to be a hotbed of religious heresy. The popular hussite movement had begun to arise and was identified as a ""czech movement"", and European powers looked to blockade and otherwise economically challenge Bohemia to curtail the power of the radicals and preserve catholic dominion.  Indeed, the principal struggle of the pre-Hussite War period was between two ethnicities and religious groups - the wealthy, (largely) ethnically German catholic nobility, sometimes called the *geschlechter*, and the less well-to-do Czech majority that was becoming increasingly reformist.  Further, Bohemia was a comparatively small, commercially backwards nation with a small population (the result of mongol invasion centuries prior), surrounded at the time by several far more important and influential nations - the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary and Poland (soon to be Poland-Lithuania). Bohemia itself consisted of provinces that largely incorporated Poles, Hungarians, Germans and a variety of slavic peoples. Even the Jews, whom have a storied history in Czech lands, would not be established until the 16th century. The most direct and ""foreign"" impact on society came from cumans, tartars and similar mercenaries and raiders that were used extensively by the Hungarians of that time period both for internal policing and external warfare.  Though Bohemia was placed upon previously important trade routes, these were swiftly deteriorating throughout the 14th-15th centuries, not only due to the relative expense of Bohemian crafts and the dangerous reputation that Bohemia held for traders, but also due to the shift of trade towards the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Germans, in particular, had moved to using Saxony - a comparatively much more stable province - to avoid having to go through Bohemia entirely when trading with Eastern Europe. The only towns that were truly even capable of trade were border towns that could get away with smuggling and covert trade with other border towns that would conceal their activity. While the Ottoman expansion had little impact on the Bohemians, the Hussite Wars would decimate trade routes and stagnate trade and commerce development for decades, if not centuries.   At the time, a notable observations was the province of Silesia. It was relatively ethnically and culturally diverse (that is, a large population of Poles, Czechs and Germans) and this was considered a sign of ""otherness"" to them, of being different from the rest of Bohemia and surrounding nations due to that diversity, which, in the early 16th Century, also began to include romance-language speakers.  That's the extent to which I am familiar with 14th-15th century Bohemia, for further reading I would suggest:  Wiszewski, P. *The multi-ethnic character of medieval Silesian society and its influence on the region’s cohesion (12th–15th centuries)*.   Karr, A. *Boundaries in the making – Historiography and the isolation of late medieval Bohemia.* (This may not be considered a strictly scientific source, but a conference paper that discusses the isolationism that Bohemia faced and was subject to in the early 15th century, for full disclosure, but it references primary and secondary sources).

665	"While a number of Western , largely conservative, critics of the New Left and the wider 1960s counterculture as communist, this did not mean the New Left was Marxist-Leninist in nature or that the USSR identified with them.The Soviet leadership was ambivalent about the New Left and this mirrored the generalized ambivalence the New Left's ideologues held for the USSR.  Although the New Left espoused a harsh critique of American society, their ideological focus was more in line with younger communist movements and leaders like Mao, Ho Chi Minh, or Che. Brezhnev and other Soviet leaders had experience with this type of ideological independence with both Tito and Mao during the 1940s and 50s and that had led them to be leery of ideological movements that deviated from Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy. The fact that the SDS did grew out of an American progressive milieu instead of the American Communist Party added a further layer of skepticism for Soviet leaders.   Moreover, the New Left would also occasionally criticized Soviet actions; one of the precursors of the New Left in Britain, the Communist Party Historians Group, which included such luminaries like E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm, openly critiqued the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. There were similiar sentiments over the Soviet's crushing of Prague Spring. Graffiti both at Berkeley's and Chicago's1968 protests drew explicit connections between American police actions and Czechoslovakia. While this graffiti (welcome to Czechago) was more about thumbing the eye of the anticommunism of the West, it was not a celebratory picture of the USSR, especially in contrast to how the ""Old Left"" romanticized the Soviet worker state in the 1930s.   The transgressive cultural precepts of the New Left, especially its liberal stance on sexual mores, were at odds with the social conservatism that typified Soviet leadership during the Brezhnev era. One of the odder quirks of Soviet state attitudes towards music in the late 1960s and 1970s was they felt that rock bands exemplified by the Rolling Stones, The Doors or Jimi Hendrix were a cultural plot by the capitalism to sap the revolutionary vigor of youth through an appeal to hedonistic excess. Many teachers and other Soviet cultural gatekeepers lamented that the arrival of Beatlemania in the late 1960s via the Baltics or western Ukraine, which was more open to connections with Western Europe, as pulling Soviet youth towards esoteric Indian philosophy and spirituality rather than more grounded subjects. The Soviet state was very quick to repress its own counterculture whose hippies took their cues from the global movement (long hair, sexual freedom, etc.).       When faced with the rise of this movement in the West, the Soviet leadership was quite confused as to what to make of it. For example, these two Soviet cartoons [1](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZLbRtrPfPKk/ThnbVSs5tDI/AAAAAAAAHhk/dbV9G3Hw0qg/s800/crocodile_1971_12.jpg) and [2](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NpefDwDrpKw/ThnbQ9r5abI/AAAAAAAAHhY/nW5rEAUX7mk/s800/crocodile_1971_16112.jpg) show solidarity with the war protesters as true representatives of the struggling masses that the USSR was on the side of. In contrast, this [cover ""Distinguishing Badges""](https://i.imgur.com/MRJ7slt.jpg) of the 1969 Soviet satirical *Krokodil*  mocked the West's fashion of long hair and androgynous clothing as does this [Soviet cartoon](http://static.messynessychic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/antistilyaga.jpg) attacked the fashionable Soviet youth while this [cartoon](https://glorialana.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/helper.jpg) mocking stylish fringed would not be so out of place in Western anti-hippie discourse.   Writing in 1975, the German journalist Klaus Mehnert observed:  &gt;The New Left is not one of the perennial topics that Soviet writers *have* to write about, rather it is a marginal phenomenon in Soviet writing [emphasis original]. Therefore, it is studied only by those especially interested. Seldom have I found anyone in the Soviet Union who even knew the New Left’s name.   Menhert found that although the Soviet state published extensively about the New Left and student protests, the state was more interested in the fact that the New Left was protesting than what in fact the New Left was actually saying.   *Sources*  Dworkin, Dennis L. *Cultural Marxism in Postwar Britain: History, the New Left, and the origins of cultural studies*.

667	I've heard this too and it definitely makes sense, North Africa was one of the richest areas of the western Roman Empire and supplied a great deal of food to Italy. However, I haven't read something that goes into detail on the actual mechanics and numbers of how this affected the Empire. My best guess would be forcing an increased reliance upon barbarian allies, the *foederati*, to supply troops. This was a process that had started much earlier, and contrary to what has been thought in the past, didn't necessarily mean the Roman army was weak. Aetius used *foederati* allies to great effect when fighting Attila. The *foederati* were not loyal to the Roman emperors, however, and often switched sides according to circumstances.	human

673	"This is the primary argument of Peter Heather in his ""The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians."" Based on figures from 440-445 in the Novella Valentiniani (one of the addendums to the Theodosian Code), he estimates that the loss of military forces based on Hugh Elton's figures for pay from Mauretania and Numidia alone were in excess of 40,000 men. Throw in Africa Proconsularis and it must have been at least twice that much.  There are... notable flaws with those numbers (for example the total cost of fielding a Comitatensian Soldier was not 6 but 30 Solidi, making that impact smaller, among other things)."	human
674	It's hard to say how large the Late Roman Army was in this era. It was larger - my own estimates put it at about 450,000 men. Primary sources from later periods (the 6th and 7th centuries) typically cite it at being between 400,000 and 650,000 men in the 4th Century AD.  The fact of the matter is that the Roman military was extremely successful in the 5th century AD, at least in the west. However it didn't go undefeated, and the Romans did suffer major defeats in most set piece battles of the 5th century. There's a pretty solid argument that the Battle of Faesulae in 405 didn't actually happen, but barring that, the Battle of Calama, The Battle of the River Utus, and the Battle of the Chersonese all resulted in military catastrophe for the Roman armies, while the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields was indecisive.  Outside of set-piece battles, the tactics of Constantius III and Aetius, while completely different, saw marked success. Constantius III was a traditional late Roman commander, operating by outmaneuvering the federate peoples he was up against, and pressuring them to surrender through starving them out or forcing them to remain on the move. His actions against the usurpers saw virtually no pitched field battles, although he won several sieges.  Aetius was a totally different commander, trained in Roman and Barbarian military theory, which he used to his advantage. Aetius operated best as effectively an ambush commander: almost all of the battles of his period from which we have any surviving details tell that he would attack before they could draw up a proper battle line.  Roman defeats came for a variety of reasons. The River Utus we don't know, the battle was as large as the Catalaunian Fields: roughly 75,000 Romans from Three Field Armies against roughly 75,000 Huns and Germanics of Attila. At the Chersonese Attila probably had them outnumbered, since they had already been destroyed at the River Utus. Calama saw Gaiseric, probably with about 15,000 warriors, defeat both Bonifatius and Aspar with combined Western Roman and Eastern Forces. The Western Roman Army in Africa had already been suffered from decades of infighting at that point, as well as having to deal with incursions from the Moors. But Gaiseric may have well simply out-generaled both Bonifatius and Aspar.  As for later events... mentions of Roman troops almost disappear after Aetius' death. Majorian's forces were almost all federates, which despite being arguably semi-Roman, weren't the same as the professional army. The forces of Ricimer, Anthemius, Libius Severus, Odoacer, and Orestes later on were likely all federates. Priscus says that Ricimer's army was composed of 6000 men, but we can't say whether they were Romans or Federates. Nevertheless, it's clear that after Aetius' death what was left of the Roman Army splintered or deserted in favor of local military figures since there was no central manager to hold their loyalty.	human

676	"Hancock's podcast appearances do well enough to explain his position on YD.  Though *Magicians* was published in 2015, obviously it took time to write it. Considering the broad spectrum of subjects he covers in the book, some of the topics gained mileage before its release. I don't see how that takes away from the magnitude of the subjects being presented. Newspapers tell yesterdays' news and that doesn't make it any less relevant.

([Here](https://phys.org/news/2018-02-ice-age-human-witnessed-larger.html) is an article from phys.org from a couple days ago reiterating the cosmic impact narrative)  These are gems for the 'anybody' since not everyone has had privileged access to scientific journals and discoveries and a mentor to explain in chew-able size. *Fingerprints* was published in 1995, that's quiet some time before internet accessibility, so learning about C.H. Hapgood's *Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings* and polar shifts was ground breaking. More so since the idea, just like YDI, was laughed at and ridiculed when published. What makes YDI such a gem is the conflict it stirs in the scientific community. I'm merely using gem to highlight the magnitude of the implication as precocious. Because when it gains consensus, many disciplines will have to do some soul searching and self evaluation.  The only response I've ever found about the possibility that the spherules being fungus is [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/34/E2245.full.pdf).

He can choose his sources as an author (and in this case he's chosen authoritative and heavily credentialed scientists). I don't understand why his decision to not use Kolata's book matters.

682	This thread is exactly what I come to this sub for, and I want to thank you for taking the time to write out this information at length -- thank you, seriously.  I was wondering if you had any recommendations for good sources documenting Sino-Khmer relations (tributary, trade, or otherwise). Your detailed answer was really enlightening, but it made me wonder about the Khmer who were a major player in SE Asia all the way through the 14th century. Any sources you can share about relations with other SE asian countries other than China would be fantastic too -- it's harder to find out that kind of information than I expected. 	human
683	Interesting Indeed. It doesn’t exist because when the Ottoman Empire was being carved up by the European victors they were creating new countries out of it and some matched up with the ethnic and religious demographics but many did not leading to the Middle East disaster we have today. And currently it’s politically unpopular to suggest the creation of a Kurdish nation despite the fact they are ethnically, politically, culturally distinct from the nations that were build around them. Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey are not likely to give up any of “their” land for the Kurdish state to exist. This is despite the fact it is mostly on rural land they do not care about, doesn’t cover that much of any country, that they already run their own territories (and have been doing that for quite awhile) with elections and everything and this would lead to a lot more peace to have a stable, democratic and secular nation around.   While the Iraqi military was fleeing Mosul, Turkey was staying in the sidelines, Syria was waging a civil war, it was the Kurdish fighters (peshmerga) that pushed back ISIS far enough for a joint US-Arab-Kurdish task force to wipe out the remaining ISIS force. They have been taking advantage of, abused, and its time for them to be given recognition instead. Israel and America has given them some level of support and respect and everyone else just avoided pissing off the nearby nations.   Many cowardly European diplomats and policy advisors rely on the avoidance of conflict as their definition of peace. That worked well with Hitler’s German invasion of Poland and Putin’s Russian invasion of Ukraine didn’t it? Dr Martin Luther King jr said “peace is not the absence of conflict but the presence of justice” I think its time for Europe and everyone else to stand up for the Kurds but seeing as nobody is telling China they can’t bully Taiwan or Tibet, Spain not to bully the Catalonians, or Russia not to bully Ukraine, I doubt much of anything will happen unless another major war between nations happens and the Kurds are needed and thus have a bargaining chip. 	human
684	The difference doesn't lie so much in the cost of the weapons--large artillery pieces continue to be expensive and cumbersome--but in the much greater manufacturing capacity of industrial nations.  Also, a direct comparison between similar weapons doesn't really capture the difference because the role of artillery changes considerably.  The majority of artillery in the 20th century is field artillery, which is a very minor role in 1430 (due to the logistical and technological constraints mentioned previously).	human
685	"It's safe to say that the Trojan War as told by Homer (or whoever really told the story) didn't actually happen, but it's quite possible that the tale has some truth to it; an amalgamation of various oral stories that had been passed down again and again, becoming more fanciful over time.  If the Trojan War has any basis in real battles, the most likely candidate is called ""Troy VII"", which is just one of the layers of a site in Anatolia, ""Hisarlik"", that was built on many different times over. There's two layers that roughly correspond to the purported period of the Trojan War: ""Troy VI"", destroyed by an earthquake around 1275 BC, and Troy VII, which is believed to have been built by the same people who lived in Troy VI on its ruins.  Troy VI shows evidence of being subjected to siege, capture, and destruction (by fire) during the general period that Greek tradition purports the Trojan War to have occurred.  However, overinterpretation of evidence is pretty rife when it comes to searching for Troy/the Trojan War, so this should be taken as a mere possibility rather than definitive proof of anything.  Outside of archaeological evidence, the Iliad makes references to pre-Homeric stories that include Achilles, which indicates that he was something of an established character beforehand, and perhaps there were many lost stories involving him dating back who knows how long. Achilles is also an authentic name that is roughly contemporary to the time period of the Trojan War. Yet there's no known historical figures who Achilles might be based on, so take that with a grain of salt; it just shows that there might have been some sort of story of a dude named Achilles that was heavily diluted/added to over the centuries until he somehow became the superhero we're familiar with.  Does this answer the question? No, not really. It's not something that will ever be definitively answered, especially since it's pretty much impossible there's some jackpot written source hiding somewhere; writing only became commonplace among Greeks about 500 years after the purported fall of Troy. But it's possible that it was actually based on *something*, though I wouldn't bet on it being anything near as grand as what The Iliad tells us.     "	human

687	"Were there black people in Prague in 1403? Maybe, there is no definitive account. Were there any around Rataje, a backwater region in a backwater isolated kingdom? How many would you expect among 10000 people there. I think that would be less than 1. So a game with less than 10000 NPCs can reasonably have no black people in it.  If Bellifortis from 1405 had a black queen Sheba with blond hair that probably means the author have never seen one. So there were no swaths of black people roaming central european countryside. And how is this cultural imperialism ""social justice""? You don't hear Czechs complaining about lack of czech characters in Hollywood ""historical"" movies about America even though there have certainly been more Czechs in America from 17th century on than black people in czech countryside. It's not like the authors are making everyone white and czech - there are cumans in the game with some asian features. "	human

693	Francisco de Enzinas, Spaniard, student of Theology and Classical Letters, had this study plan, designed by Philip Melanchthon. The lessons would be in Latin, as it was usual for the time period. Letter from Melanchthon to Enzinas, Wittenberg, 1542:      Method and study plan, along with a list of tropes, all of it prepared by Philip Melanchthon, for the use of a certain Spaniard.1542:   Everyday, in the morning and the evening, you shall read, as prayers, a text from the Holy Bible, with certain attention in order to understand it and to incite the spirit towards devotion, fear, and faith. And while you read, you have to recapacitate on what stories they are, to what tropes they correspond, which of them predicate on pennance, and on fear, how they contain the promise of the Gospels, and examples of faith; how they contain the Law and punishments -as the lectures on Cain, Sodom, the Flood, the Plagues of Egypt-; and how the Church is admirably preserved amongst the fall of the succesive peoples; and you have to admire its order, the diffusion of the Church; you have to pay attention to chronology. On the more obscure passages, you have to listen to the opinions of prudent men, and experts, and have to find a concise and simple explanation.   Twice per week, you have to dedicate an hour to the study of the Theology, and a second hour, so you yourself read at home, with some commentary, the Epistle to the Romans, and later Genesis or Isaiah. The rest of the time can be devoted to go the lectures you find pleasing, and in part to read classical Greek and Latin authors. My advice on the lecture of Latin texts at home is this: at home, every week, you shall dedicate one hour a day, and an extra one, to Cicero, carefully distributed, so sometimes you read letters and some other times, discourses. Furthermore, you shall dedicate one hour or two one day to Livy, not only for its History, but also for his eloquence. Wednesday and Saturday, you shall consecrate to Greek language; read at home the Lives of Plutarch, and, on your own, translate some things from Lucian. You also have to make this language exercises: a daily lecture of the New Testament, and of Aristotle's Ethics. You don't have to take this plan in a strict sense, but as the jurists say *sensu lato*. Meanwhile, there are some other things to be read, be them classical or contemporary, be them to distract your mind or to strengthen your criterium. I wish you would pay attention to the poets, and that you wrote verses every once in a while, for the reading of poets greatly favours those who write in prose with some elegance. The diversity of genres, the powerful figures, and the brilliant amplifications can be taken from poets. On the holidays you can read some psalm; and you shall, and you shall read it so you find its true meaning, its simple sense, natural and original; you shall choose some pslams, that can serve as prayers, such as: Miserere, Ad te levavi, De profundis, Domine ne in furore tuo, Domini exaudi orationem, Deus venerunt gentes...    List of common tropes:   God. The World. Providence: Providence rules everything. Religion. The Sun. The sky. The moon. The stars: succession of stars. Predictions. Succession of seasons: Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring. The Elements: fire, water, earth, air. The celestial phenomens: prodigies, comets. Extension of the Earth: its division.    Amasis, according to Herodotus, writes to King Polycrates this: there are many days in a year, and many hours, and many more are the moments, but there is no moment that cannot cast you down.

700	Usual practice was to stand the pikes in the ground, vertically, point-up. This keeps the pike off damp ground, so it stays drier. One important function of buttspikes on pikes was to make it easier to store the pikes in this way when camping. It's an old practice, going back to ancient times - Greek hoplites would stand their spears upright in the same way.  Some contemporary art showing this:  * Late 16th century; note the pikes standing upright behind the cannons at the left-hand side of the camp: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kulturbilder_481-482.JPG  * From 1675: https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/RP-T-00-143  Also, a different way to stand pikes upright. Here, pikes are stuck upright in straw-covered structures:  http://www.zeno.org/Kunstwerke/B/Cranach+d.+J.,+Lucas%3A+Die+Belagerung+von+Wolfenbüttel,+Gesamtansicht  Note that these structures are hollow - they aren't just piles of hay, but must be a framework covered in straw.	human
701	The setting of a game and the game's mechanics are clearly very different parts of the game, mechanics often being unrealistic because playing a game where a single bullet can immobilise you is not very fun to play, for most people, at least.  The setting, however, is something that tries to be as realistic as possible, if that game is a historical game, at least. This is why I don't like the idea or black people or Asians in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Likewise, White people in a video game set in 16th century sub-Saharan Africa would also be very unrealistic, and it would break immersion for me. My issue definitely isn't with black people in the game 'because I don't like black people'.	human
702	"&gt; So a game with less than 10000 NPCs can reasonably have no black people in it.   Why? It can have a dead blacksmith's son (probably killed by the king himself) become a knight in the service of a fictional lord. It's fiction in a video game setting, meaning a setting that even more so than movies or literature has to compromise a lot of ""realness"" already in order to be playable (health restoration, endurance, jumping, and what not). You know, if you don't want black people in your medieval games, that a position you can take but from my standpoint, there is conceivably no valid historical argument to support that position. Because if we start looking at this and other games from the perspective of matching up with sources and scholarship, there simply is no game that is accurate.  As for the ""cultural imperialism"" argument, there certainly is an interesting discussion to be had about approaches to representation and authenticity in entertainment media from non-US cultures but in this particular case, I'd argue it doesn't apply that much because what we are talking about here is a game made for an English-language audience, with English promotional material, and a clearly global audience in mind, not a Czech historical movie production geared towards a Czech audience.

En í borginni var höfðingi sá, er Óðinn var kallaðr   &gt; The country east of the Tanaquisl in Asia was called Asaland, or Asaheim, and the chief city in that land was called Asgaard.

704	"&gt; Video games can never be fully realistic or historical  Yes.  &gt; therefore they should include unrealistic or historical points  I assume you meant ""ahistorical"" here. And my argument is not that they necessarily should but that ""historical accuracy"" is not an applicable valid argument in discussions such as these. Whether we want to see video games as products manufactured in a cultural context or as silly entertainment products, they are what they are: Fictional spaces.  And while we can assess these fictional spaces in their representation of history to our utmost liking and can heap criticism or praise on them on that front, they are not a medium geared towards historical accuracy because by way of the format they are unable to represent it.  The whole point is not what I think video games should and should not do. It's that in justifying certain creative decisions concerning fiction products, historical accuracy is an argument that is rarely applicable as sole justification.      "	human

706	"&gt; I think that some people would argue that forcefully insisting that a Czech studio making a game set in Czechia absolutely has to go out of its way to take into account predominantly American and Western European social and political issues has certain... distasteful cultural imperialist undertones, and that that's where a part of the opposition comes from. Certainly, no place in Europe has been untouched by the history of racism but the Czech Republic is hardly very high on the list of places associated with and responsible for colonialism and slavery, etc.   As I wrote elsewhere in this thread here that is an interesting conversation to have but I think that argument is not fully justified here in the sense that this is after all a product with a global and specifically Western and US audience in mind and also marketed as such. It at its very basis is conceived as a product within the metric and standards of Western audience consumption and not e.g. as a Czech film marketed to Czech audiences.  As to your last point, aside the fact that I think the inclusion of Roma would be in an Eastern European context more controversial than you assume here, my argument was not really geared towards establishing obligations, but rather to show why I think that within the conversation concerning the reasons for not including more diversity ""historical accuracy"" is not really an applicable argument."	human
707	"If I may add my two cents - given that I am no professional and that the matter is far removed from my field of interests - by looking at the issue from outside.   Why is it necessary to find a historically accurate justification for the inculsion of black people in a game?   There are as you pointed out many choices - either narrative, contextual, of environment - that are made with the player's experience in mind and are neither accurate nor verisimile: the bridge is there so that you can cross the river; the gates are closed because it's not time to leave the city yet; the army is coming because we need a battle in the story. Given that the average player is not a historian, ""historically accurate"" becomes essentially clickbait. The game is (rightfully?) driven by the player's agency and by the story one wants to tell.   The issue then appears to be not whether the inclusion of black characters is accurate or verisimile, but whether it improves of detracts from the player's experience.   What seems to irk the historians - and I think it's a more than legitimate point - is the fact that there is a lot of real history (of culture, religion, beliefs, common life) behind the chosen setting, that is tossed away in favor of a moot point: there is no historical justification for the inclusion or exclusion of black people and I don't think there is any need for it. But if that is what breaks the player's immersion, then maybe the player should question his own agency within the game.  If we look at the game context, the design choices - and I agree that consistency there is relevant - it's fair to wonder if the dichotomy black-white is a decisive trait in the design choice (an element of verisimilitude), a theme of the game, an issue that develops from the narrative choices of the game makers; or rather an issue that comes from the players that carry over ideas that are as foreign to the game's context as they can be."	human

710	"The word 'album' is an interesting one. The use of the word to describe, say, a 12-inch 33rpm record is a relatively recent one; the earlier meaning of the word is the one associated with the 'photo album', which the online Oxford dictionary describes as '[a blank book for the insertion of photographs, stamps or pictures](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/album)', and which dates from the 17th century. But yes, think of the (physical) photo albums with clear, little photo-sized pouches, the ones that your parents might bring out to show your baby photos.  Early musical albums were albums in *this* sense. Before the invention of the 10"" and 12"" 33rpm records, there was only a very limited amount of time that could be stored on the 78rpm records that were standard - 3-4 minutes' worth. As a result, before the advent of the 10"" and 12"" 33rpm records, an album was an album like a photo album - basically a case that held several 78rpm records rather than several photos. Initially these albums were likely simply produced for people to store their 78rpm records in, in the same way that people in the 1990s would store their CDs in a lightweight case with little pouches for the CDs, if they were travelling around with a discman. However, by the 1940s, albums were being sold that were pre-stocked with 78rpm records - a set of songs that were *meant* to go together.  Examples of albums in this sense, in the sense of a package with multiple 78rpm records that were sold together in this sense include [Frank Sinatra's first album, *The Voice Of Frank Sinatra*](https://www.discogs.com/Frank-Sinatra-The-Voice-Of-Frank-Sinatra/release/3168364) from 1946 (on discogs, you can see images of what the album looks like if you click on 'more images' under the album cover there), or [Woody Guthrie's *Dust Bowl Ballads*](https://www.discogs.com/Woody-Guthrie-Dust-Bowl-Ballads-Sung-By-Woody-Guthrie-Volume-I/release/4580310) from 1940. And of course, there are plenty of early recordings of lengthy classical pieces like the movements and suites of Bach's solo cello music, which are split up into albums this way.  It was only with the advent of the 10"" and 12"" records that the album in the modern sense - everything on the one reasonably length disc, or in the same Spotify folder, for that matter, came to be; these continued to be called albums for convenience, to trumpet that they were a collection of songs. The first 10"" album, featuring eight songs on the one disc, that Frank Sinatra would release was in March 1950, *Dedicated To You*. And the first 12"" album that Sinatra would release was in 1956, *In The Wee Small Hours*.  So the specific concept of 'album' was intimately connected with sound being contained on physical objects. However, if you mean something a little broader than 'album', something more like a set of connected songs that 'people would listen to bits of it on their own, or out of order' and seeing we're talking about Bach, the two books of Bach's *The Well-Tempered Clavier* comes to mind? This is of course a manuscript of Bach's compositions, and each of the two books includes a prelude and fugue for each of the major and minor keys that were possible on a well-tempered clavier (i.e., a keyboard). As far as I'm aware, there's no clear expectation with *The Well-Tempered Clavier* that the pieces should be presented together, or in a particular order, though they are often presented that way in recordings. Certainly, [modern performance of the complete preludes and fugues sometimes sees performers mixing up the order of performance, as this review of a Sydney performance indicates](http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/js-bach-the-welltempered-clavier-review-exhausting-for-the-player-energising-for-his-audience-20150119-12t9m5.html)."	human
711	That is a very good point to make, usurpation by a Roman general was a constant threat during the later part of the Roman Empire and was responsible for a huge amount of chaos and disruption. But I do believe that the civil wars of the fifth century, where *foederati* leaders rebelled and fought against the Empire, were fundamentally different. Pre-fifth century, a Roman general might rebel and march his army to Italy to contend with the emperor. In simplified form, they would fight, one would emerge victorious, and Rome would have a militarily competent emperor. If there was another usurper, the same process would repeat - either the usurper or emperor wins, and Rome still has a strong leader. In the fifth century, the leaders of the *foederati* were barbarian, non-Romans, and therefore could never become emperor. It would have never been accepted by the Senate, the people, or the Roman majority of the armies. So when a *foederati* rebelled, they did not try to make themselves the Roman emperor, they went for a different prize - mostly land or looting. Alaric, perhaps one of the best documented regular rebels, spent time looting Greece, would later loot Rome, but was also seeking a large grant of land for his people in Illyricum. Other parties, such as the Visigoths, would team up with Aetius against the mutual threat of Attila, but would then be at war with Majorian soon after. To me it appears decidedly different. How determinative was this difference on the fate of the Empire? I think significantly.	human

I have not seen any analysis of alcohol content, but I see no reason to assume that it was anything but within the spectrum of possibilities available today (not all modern whiskeys have the same alcoholic content).  If someone bought an entire bottle, he could take it with him and wouldn't necessarily finish it at one setting - which would, indeed be impressive. I've seen primary source diaries, where it is recorded that ""we demolished a bottle of whiskey"" while traveling on a stage or during some other outing. Here we have two or more men sharing a bottle that has been taken off premise."	human
713	The trireme is a lot more relevant to Athenian democracy than it may seem. You have some good sources already, but I'll go through and suggest some others that you may find useful to build up your wiki.  The key question to ask is what a trireme *is*, or more specifically, what makes a trireme different from earlier kinds of ships used by the Greeks. The two main points are that firstly a trireme is much bigger (needing four times as many crew as a *pentekonter*), and secondly that a trireme, unlike earlier ships, is *only* a warship. It cannot be used effectively for raiding or piracy or trade. It carries too many mouths and doesn't have enough room in the hull for anything besides rowers. Building triremes, then, means building a battle fleet. And their large crew meant that they were terribly expensive, and laid claim to a lot of manpower. Try to get a hold of Hans van Wees' *Ships and Silver, Taxes and Tribute* (2012), which lays this out in some detail.  How does that relate to democracy? Well, with our basic understanding of triremes as large, expensive weapons of war, we can ask some fundamental questions that should lead you to the answer:  * Where is the money coming from? * Where are the crews coming from? * What happens when these crews prove vital to their state's war effort?  Many ancient sources spell out the answers to these questions. Have a look at the pamphlet called the [Constitution of the Athenians](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/students/modules/introhist/usefuldocuments/old_oligarch.pdf), written in the 420s BC by an anonymous author known to modern scholars as the Old Oligarch. You'll find very similar sentiments in Plato's *Republic*, Aristotle's *Politics*, and Plutarch's *Life of Themistokles* and *Life of Perikles*. Fundamentally, what you need to be doing is to substantiate this claim by Aristotle:  &gt; But [the current democratic system] does not seem to have come about in accordance with the intention of Solon, but rather as a result of accident, for the common people having been the cause of the naval victories at the time of the Persian invasion became proud and adopted bad men as popular leaders when the respectable classes opposed their policy.  -- Aristotle, *Politics* 1274a.10-14  I hope this helps!	human
714	"Kudos, it's amazing how someone can write so much about a subject he knows so little.  &gt;Ottomans were a rather important force back in 16th century Europe with their whole array of diverse troops and people expanding as far as Hungary and holding power over vast swaths of Southeastern and Central Europe   1.The game tkase place in 1403  2. Otomans never hold power over Bohemia, we are talking about very specific region, so there is no point in bringing these general arguments about ""Southeastern"" or ""Central Europe""  3. Cumans, a Turkic nomadid people settled in Hungary are important part of the games, as they invaded Bohemia back then and the game literally revolves around this event.  &gt;Also, historians have nitpicked Warhorse for a variety of their claims about the Middle Ages in Bohemia in general.  Oh yes, this ""historian"" uses standard RPG terms for playing styles such as ""knight"" and ""bard"" which are used for marketing purposuses to question historical accuarcy of the game. You can't become knight in the game, it is just a term used for a gamplay style. And you can't really get more intelectualy dishonenest than using Ethiopian delegation to Spain in 1306 or St. Maurice statute as a proof of black people in 1403 rural Bohemia.    &gt;Kingdom Come: Delieverance advertises itself as a ""realistic single-player RPG set in medieval Europe"" with ""period accurate melee combat."" And here is a first taste of where the understanding of what is historical accuracy lies: combat and weapons minutae.   Not true, they are actually trying to make as historicaly accurate as possible everything. From colour of carrot and chickens, clothing, weapons, to ethnical distribution.  &gt;Because the ""historical accuracy"" the game developer as well as those resisting the idea of having PoC or female characters in this game cite, is at best, a very selective kind of accuracy, at worst a cudgel used to silence perspectives they don't agree with.  That's just your idelogical asumption based on nothing. And just like someone else pointed out, it pretty much boils down to the argument that ""if you can't make it 100% accurate, you might as well add elves."" There ovisouly always must be compromises beacuse it is still a game, but that can not prevent you from trying to make it ""as historicaly accurate as possible"". Which is actually hudnred times repeated matra o the developers, they have never claimed to be 100% accurate. And arguing that not adding black characters to a game which takes places in area of 16km2 in a rural Bohemia 1403 is either ""selective accuracy"" or some kind of malevonet intent is absolutely ridiculous and bordeline crazy.  And regarding the female charater, yet again you are simply not telling the truth. The developers have never claimed that having main character as a female wouln't be historicaly possible, they actually said the opposite, that it would be definitely possible, but it would require them to basicaly write two different stories, they can't simply swap gender of the MC and let everyone react to them in the same way. The story was writen around a man and they didn't want to have something generic genderless like Skyrim.  &gt;This is also why the ""historical accuracy"" argument is employed very selectively: It stands out as a positive when it comes to the recreation of objects, it is used as a defense against the inclusion of black people or female characters.   I already dealt with this one, so again, the developers have never used ""historical accuracy"" against having female character (I asume you mean a playable character, because otherwise there is obviously a lot of female characters in the game). And you can't claim not including black charecters is selective when in your whole ideologocial essey you are incapable of producing a single evidence that there were black characters in Posazavi region of 14km2 in 1403, and when all the available evidence shows the opposite.  &gt;It is not applied to the story of a blacksmith defining the future of Bohemia Another lie, the game main point which it tries to differentiate from others is that you are NOT defining future of Bohemia, that you are NOT a superhero, that you can NOT change the history, and  you are unimportant soldier who can't lead armies.  &gt;In the end what it comes down to is this: Would it be historically accurate, as in backed up by scholarship on the period, to find black people in Medieval Europe? Yes, it would as above linked discussion.   Totaly irrelevant, we are not speaking about some generic ""Medieval Europe"", we are speaking about specific 1403 rural area of 16km2 in Bohemia recreated based on satelite pictures and archeological findings. Stop using this fallacy.  &gt;And even if, one could argue, it is just a silly piece of media that has nothing to do with current cultural forces, then too nothing stands in the way of having black NPCs and female characters. If it is nothing more than historically inspired fantasy without wider implications then too a developer is free to include black, brown, female and Asian characters to their hearts delight.  And again and again, this same argument aka ""you might as well add elves"". This game has full time historian on their team since the beginning and consults top historians on the era on daily baisis, they try to achieve way more than just ""historically inspired fantasy"", that's just another false asumptions.  &gt;The only place an opposition to the inclusion of black people and women can arguably come from is because developers and customers don't want black people in their games – and that has, to me, some highly questionable implications.  Ah, the ultimate argument of all for closure - they are rasist.  Congratulation, you wrote a fine piece of ideological propaganda without any relation to facts or history.   "	human

If that's true, it would be logical that the Empire would be fighting *less* and not more relative to the earlier civil wars in their struggles with the *foederati*.  Also, to my knowledge, Visigoths were granted only a third of the land during their settlement in Aquitania, and not all of it, so it's not like there would be some significant upheaval. 	human

And even if we could, why on Earth would we point the finger at Agesilaos? What possible purpose could be served by his burning down the temple of Poseidon? Are you suggesting this just because he ordered fire to be brought to his detachment on the heights overlooking the area in the line preceding Xenophon's remark about the burning temple? It should not need to be pointed out that these events are not related; the bringing of fire to the troops was about getting them warm, whereas burning the temple could have no such purpose. Are you suggesting Xenophon is covering up his friend's gross act of sacrilege in order to preserve his reputation for piety?

724	Actually, this is a great question, and how the answer changes over time says a lot about the medieval revival of Rome!  In the early Middle Ages, city land--including old imperial buildings--passed into the dominion of the Church, specifically the papacy, as it built its power first of all in Rome. Through the ninth-tenth century, one of the things we see is that legally, only the pope and his agents had the power to dismantle abandoned Roman buildings for their stones, tiles, decoration. Above all, of course, they built churches!  However, with the revival of international trade and a renewal of Roman lay population, starting in the 12th century, powerful Roman families bought land and ruins into private ownership. They actually built with pieces of, but also into existing, Roman structures for their own palace-like houses. By the fourteenth century, scholars estimate, most of Rome the city that was not explicitly used by the Church was under private ownership.	human

726	"The Roman triumphal procession, like the ancient funeral with the coins over the eyes and bloodsoaked gladiatorial fights, are very powerful images in the modern imagination of the ancient world but are surprisingly slippery to pin down in reliable sourcing. To give an illustration of just how slippery it can be, Mary beard's *The Roman Triumph* is a 400+ page book dedicated entirely to tracking down where in the ancient source this modern image came from--the painted face, captives marched in chains, displays of booty, and a slave whispering ""remember death""--and comes to the conclusion that there actually is not one. All of these are attested separately in one way or another (""remember death"" comes from the early Christian author Tertullian), but the creation of a singular ""Roman Triumph"" with set elements is a modern one.  This does not mean that triumphal processions were not very important parts of a noble Romans career, but their specific form was not set. Arguably this is what made them so important--the ability of powerful leaders to shape the event to their own purposes."	human
727	"For the simple reason that shoes, like clothing and other personal property, was a resource the camp system would seize and redistribute back to Germany. In the case of shoes, there were shortages of shoes within Germany as the war increasingly ate up stocks of leather and rubber. The use of *ersatz* synthetic materials such mipolam or cellulose caused a degree of civilian grumbling. The shoes of murdered Jews or other KZ inmates was a way to feed back prewar-level quality shoes back into the Reich's civilian economy. This expropriation and redistribution system grew larger and more sophisticated as the camp system evolved. The area of Auschwitz nicknamed [""Kanada""](http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/album_auschwitz/kanada.asp) became infamous in survivor memories for being a site of looting the valuables of murdered Jews. Of course, the SS often had the pick of this loot, including shoes, and there was a great deal of corruption in this process.   Jews who survived selection or other inmates tended to receive camp-issued wooden clogs. These too feature heavily in memories of the Holocaust, especially the ""click-clack"" sound they made as KZ inmates increasingly were used to repair bomb damage. Corruption within the camp system did also mean some of the looted shoes found their way back into the camps on the feet of various *Prominenten*  or *Kapo* prisoners in charge of other prisoners.   So asking Jews to remove their shoes was not just about ritualized humiliation or to ease the extermination process, although those were factors operating in the Holocaust. The wider Nazi mentality was that all Jewish wealth was stolen so they held no moral qualms about taking every last bit of personal property from the Jews they murdered, including what was on their victims' feet.

729	"Not sure about satellite imagery finding more ( especially under polar ice caps) but the 19th century saw the removal of many imaginary ones, previously charted ones did not in fact exist. In his 1984 book *Lost Islands*, oceanographer Henry Stommel listed numerous islands, rocks, etc. that were mistakenly placed in charts in earlier times that were found to be erroneous, like [Pepys island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepys_Island). The creation of them was natural: any navigator would err on the side of caution, if he thought he saw something that could wreck his ship, and until a solution to finding longitude came in the 18th c., precise charting of such places for was difficult.  Thus, not only could islands be imagined, but existing ones could be reported twice, placed in different locations.  Stommel credited the 19th c.whaling industry with eliminating most of them. International shipping had, sensibly, tended to follow the shortest routes, and exploratory voyages were not constant. But whalers would cruise for years, criss-crossing many latitudes, especially in those in the  antarctic, below the difficult southern ""roaring forties"" where no one previously had much reason to travel. They essentially created an oceanographic survey fleet, over decades eliminating or confirming the existence of such places."	human
730	In a word no, they could not cut or pierce through plate.  Plate armour as a whole made cutting and thrusting attacks to the protected areas exceedingly difficult (in the case of transitional plate's much more piecemeal composition) if not wholly useless (as with gothic plate's emphasis on fluting to reinforce areas from bending and angular designs to deflect strikes). In response this saw the rise of such pole arms as halberds and the bec de corbin which used their greater leverage to generate the force needed to crush or pierce and blunt weapons like maces and war hammers which aimed to bludgeon the person underneath.   Ignoring the issues of cost and the type of soldiers used in such a wide period, which is a subject (or several) in its own, we go straight towards what it a two handed sword could achieve despite these disadvantages, namely half swording and the mordhau or murder strike.  Some basis first of the typology of swords following the development of transitional plate in the despite this we see the development of transitional plate of the 13th C. It is around this time we the development of two handed swords like the [XIIa](https://www.albion-swords.com/articles/images/typology/typology/XIIa.jpg) and [XVa](https://www.albion-swords.com/articles/images/typology/typology/XVa.jpg) in Oakeshott's typology, with this point marking a trend towards swords with narrow pointed tips with an emphasis on thrusting. This followed as maille became more common on the battlefield and retained this feature as maille was used to under early white plate and to fill the gaps in later gothic and italian.   So now we look at both half swording and the mordhau.[ In this plate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Augsburg_Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2_%28Codex_Wallerstein%29_107v.jpg) from the codex Wallerstein of the 15th C we see half swording being used from the person on the left and the mordhau from the one on the right. Despite what you may think, it is safe to grab hold of the bare blade even with your naked hand, especially with some later swords such as the estoc which forewent having an edge.   Half swording allows for a much greater control of the point of the sword for thrusting as well as some additional force to the strike. Yet despite this tapered thrusting point and technique it was not for going through plate but around into the areas protected by maille and/or padding such as the armpits, the gap between breastplate and cuisse or even the eye slits in the helm if the opponent was wrestled to the ground. By striking these areas it was possible to kill or wound opponent in plate.  Then there's the mordhau. By gripping the weapon by the blade the pommel of the sword could be used as a bludgeon to strike against (popularly) the helmet to concuss or other areas less well protected such as the elbow and side of the knee to incapacitate. Some swords of the the 14th and 15th C used pointed or spiked pommels [\(seen more clearly in this talhoffer manuscript\)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Ms.XIX.17-3_16v.png) to concentrate the force in a much smaller area thereby making it more effective.  Whilst this may beg the question of why it was still used despite other more specialised weapons such as the aforementioned halberd and war hammer being better suited for plate armour combat, it can be simply answered by the fact it wasn't specialised, that it was more versatile let it remain the a choice side arm. 	human
731	"Most of the ancient manuscripts we have survive in copies from the medieval times (roughly later than the 7th century, most of them come from the 8th/9th centuries). There are very few ancients manuscripts around, for instance the ""papiri di Ercolano"" which contain the teachings of ancient philosophers (Epicureans, here a link to wiki: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum_papyri#/media/File%3AHerculaneum_papyrus_1425.png). We have very little else, so much so that book studies are known to have a ""bottleneck"" at about the 6/7th centuries. This is because the decline of classical culture in Europe, coupled with technological changes that brought on the book as we know it vs the papyrus roll. These and other circumstances made for a process of selection, meaning that only some (very very few) things were copied and handed down to us. In general, most of the classical literature we have comes from medieval manuscripts, many incomplete, or corrupted. It is the work of philologists to piece them together and hopefully reconstruct the ""original version"" of a work of literature from the past.  A good ""beginner's"" source (I put it in brackets because it's a very detailed book) on manuscript studies is ""The Manuscript Book: A Compendium of Codicology"" by M.L. Agati.

736	"Were they stored away? Yeah. BUT here's something you have to understand about ancient texts in general. It is often the case that what you are reading are simply copies. And they're not just copies, they can be copies of copies of copies of copies of copies and so forth.  That's usually how it went for many Greek and Latin texts that survive today. We have copies created by monks at various monasteries who would copy a manuscript onto a fresh sheet of paper/papyri, wax, etc.  Now as for your question regarding if we are lucky to have these texts, you goddamn right we are. You really have to thank these monasteries and basically the Vatican (they have a robust and collected library of ancient texts) for scribbling down and copying of this stuff for the last few centuries. The largest ancient libraries in the world like Alexandria and Babylon have been destroyed by either invaders seeking to destroy a culture's legacy or natural disasters. A huge part of ancient literature and humanity's past has been lost to us - probably forever, lest we get really really really really lucky in the future.

737	Thanks for the observations!  From what I found, the game was outlined as being set specifically in 1403, which is towards the end of the reign of Wenceslas IV and a few years after he was deposed as King of Germany. If the developer's intention was to set it around the end of the reign of Charles IV, then yes - Bohemia would have been a prosperous, cultured kingdom and most of what I've written would be mostly for the period following it, corresponding to the late 14th to 15th century.  The observation about size is correct - for a HRE territory, it was very substantial, but I wrote it in mind from the perspective of surrounding countries (counting the HRE as a separate territory) - where it is substantially smaller.

738	"&gt; Why is it necessary to find a historically accurate justification for the inculsion of black people in a game?  &gt; Given that the average player is not a historian, ""historically accurate"" becomes essentially clickbait.  First, I don't think people who like historical fiction have to justify liking it.  Some people are really into this stuff.   Second, I think that you are being far too flippant about verisimilitude in a creative work.  Yes, fictionalizations of history deviate from real history, by definition (partly from the fictional part, partly from omissions caused by an inability to portray all of a historical reality in a limited number of pages).  Yes, games set in fictionalized historical settings deviate from those settings in order to create gameplay.  No, this does not mean that you've broken verisimilitude so anything goes now.    I think you might have an easier time seeing more clearly on the subject if you allowed yourself to consider a non political issue, where you don't look down upon the people who are on the other side.  Try replacing every instance of ""black people"" in the above arguments with ""cowboys.""  Finally, because apparently its important in this thread- I see a massive difference between arguing for the inclusion of black or dark skinned characters on the grounds of realism or historical plausibility, versus arguing that there's no excuse for not including them once you've fictionalized the setting in some other way.  I only object to the latter argument.  Verisimilitude isn't like some weird creative version of victorian era virginity norms, where once its lost you might as well do anything anyone likes because if you're not chaste you're a [censored].

739	"No, the logic is that a game is inherently non-historical and inaccurate, therefore excusing design decisions on the basis of ""accuracy"" is dishonest. If you make a design decision, then actually defend it. Don't hide behind supposed ""accuracy"" when the entire conceit of the game is ludicrous on its face."	human
740	"&gt; As I wrote elsewhere in this thread here that is an interesting conversation to have but I think that argument is not fully justified here in the sense that this is after all a product with a global and specifically Western and US audience in mind and also marketed as such. It at its very basis is conceived as a product within the metric and standards of Western audience consumption and not e.g. as a Czech film marketed to Czech audiences.  That's certainly a good point, especially if the game is being funded by Western money too. But I'm not sure it's quite that straightforward. After all, the decision to set the game in a strongly local setting rather unfamiliar to your average American or Western European seems to me to indicate that appealing to them is not necessarily as primary a motivation, but more a simple consequence of the fact that it'd be hard for a game of this level to be financially successful in any other way. Which can again lead back to discussions about issues of American/Western economic and cultural dominance. And, for sure, considering that they are also aiming for that audience (regardless of the reasons) it would probably be smart for them to take these expectations into account too, for commercial reasons if nothing else, but it's also a bit unfair to place as high an expectation of ""getting it right"" on them as if the game was being made in, say, USA. As with so many online discussion of this kind, a lot of unnecessary energy seems to be wasted on people yelling at each other (""You're racist!"", ""You're politically correct!"") without appreciating the nuances of the situation (not directing this at you).  Also, I'm just not sure how far this needs to be taken? Who has an obligation to include what? Would an Icelandic studio making a game in medieval Iceland need to include a black person? A Russian studio making a game set in medieval Russia? A Japanese studio making a game set in old Japan? Does it really just depend on if they plan on selling the game in the West? I don't know, instead of spending too much energy on fighting for what frankly seems like scraps to me, it seems to me like it would be much better to push for making and marketing games set in non-European settings, preferably by non-European studios. These places have fascinating histories, and exploring them would do much more for enabling all manners of human experience to be represented in games.  &gt;aside the fact that I think the inclusion of Roma would be in an Eastern European context more controversial than you assume here  You're right, I should have worded that better, I don't want to minimize the high level of discrimination Roma face in these countries. Instead of less opposition - arguably there might be even more, or at least more prominent opposition - I should have said more support, considering this is an actual reasonably prominent issue there, with programs for the inclusion of Roma being generally even a matter of government policy (how successful and well-conceived they are is another question).  &gt; but rather to show why I think that within the conversation concerning the reasons for not including more diversity ""historical accuracy"" is not really an applicable argument.  Certainly, your points there were valid and well presented and I'd broadly agree with them. I just took issue with the claim in your last passage, and sort of spun off some unrelated thoughts from there."	human
741	"This is a bit of a non-answer, but very few first person accounts exist much before Pepys.  Common folks weren't literate and nobody was particularly interested in their stories.  One notable exception is Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. While the stories are fictional and often tongue-in cheek, Chaucer compiles an insightful look at late medieval life and the very first people you might call ""middle class.""  With that said, you will need to look more at anthropology and archaeology to find accounts of everyday people prior 17th or 18th century.

744	"&gt;As for the ""cultural imperialism"" argument, there certainly is an interesting discussion to be had about approaches to representation and authenticity in entertainment media from non-US cultures but in this particular case, I'd argue it doesn't apply that much because what we are talking about here is a game made for an English-language audience, with English promotional material, and a clearly global audience in mind, not a Czech historical movie production geared towards a Czech audience.  It seems to have this global and English-speaking audience in mind with this approach though, capitalizing on the conspicuously-for-this-sub modern political climate to challenge the assertion that said audience is part of the culture that wants to see diversity and representation at the cost of what they might feel is more authentic; if we're throwing accuracy out the window anyway."	human

747	"Yes, Queen Victoria was upset, although her concern was tempered. As a young princess, she was highly sympathetic to the native Irish as a whole when she learned about the historical and present oppression visited on them by her ancestors; it's been argued that her feelings were turned early in her rule by her highly influential first Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. Ireland had been undergoing civil unrest through the 1830s due to poor crop yields and high rents charged by absentee English landowners, and when Victoria came to the throne in 1837, she came to believe that the issue was the ""low Irish"" (a term frequently used during this time for Irish people, particularly those that had emigrated to England, who were destitute and seen as having caused or deserving their problems through fecklessness and irresponsibility) revolting against good or at least well-intentioned local leaders. This obviously had implications for leaders farther up the chain of command! Stricter measures were taken by the government against the ""low Irish"", and Victoria was disinclined to visit for fear of her own safety.  When the potato blight hit and destroyed two years' worth of crops, the queen urged her new PM Robert Peel to repeal the Corn Laws, which had put high import duties on foreign food and thus caused even more economic devastation when crops in the UK failed (such as with the Great Famine). She also limited the palace bread rations to a pound per person per day in order to cut down on the use of grain/flour, freeing up more to be sent to Ireland; she gave £2000 from her personal income and encouraged others to donate to the cause. However, she still retained her old prejudices, and while she was horrified at the suffering of the poor Irish, she was disdainful of those that revolted violently against their landlords for hoarding/diverting food.  Eventually, the royal family did visit. The lord mayor of Dublin invited the queen to come in 1844, but the unrest (and then famine) made her and the government disinclined to actually go through with it. Finally, in 1849, Victoria, Albert, and the oldest four children went on a low-budget state visit to improve relations between the Irish and stimulate trade and manufacture, which ended up costing roughly £2000 itself, canceling out her donation. Victoria and Albert were charmed by what they saw and considered it a great success - despite the desperate circumstances, there were still plenty of cheering crowds - but her itinerary was designed to keep her out of the hard-hit areas and in the long run it did little to calm tensions. One has to wonder what might have happened if she had given Ireland the kind of patronage she gave to Scotland: would it have created a similar tourist industry and brought in more money for the region? Would there have been more sympathy on the part of the English toward the rural Irish? Would the government of Dublin have kept the statue of Albert she sent following his death, the return of which helped to make Victoria okay with neglecting Ireland for the rest of her reign? We don't know that it would have made a difference to the history of Irish separatism, but it's an interesting counterfactual to ponder."	human

754	The New England settlers are well-known historically for their detailed diaries. The New England Puritans were an exceptionally literate people who believed the ability to read the bible was essential to understanding the word of God. Thus, children were educated using the Bible as a resource.  Their diaries have a decidedly religious tone, especially those diaries written in the early 17th century. There is still much to be learned about day-to-day life in English North America from these diaries. Comparatively, records and diaries from French North America (my specialty) come overwhelmingly from clergy and colonial officials, so those are probably not what you're looking for.  Online archives are an excellent resource for locating these diaries, which were often reprinted by later scholars or descendants. I use the [Canadian National Archives](http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/) and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) when conducting digital research.  You can read a collection of New England personal narratives [here](https://archive.org/details/newenglanddiarie00forbuoft). I hope this was helpful	human
755	Cut or pierce through? Hardly. However, there was a half-swording technique called **der mordschlag**, which consisted in grabbing the long sword by the blade and striking the opponent [with the guard or pommel](https://edmcdonaldwritingdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/half-swording.jpg?w=475&amp;h=343), effectively using the sword as an improvised mace; in this way, you could deal meaningful damage to the armour and potentially cause a severe trauma. You would then close the distance and *insert* (because some precision was required) your [blade into one of the gaps between plates](http://www.schlachtschule.org/pictures/a-half.jpg) to finish them off. Gripping the blade in this case would allow you to strike with heightened precision, as you have greater control over the tip of the blade.  As for what other uses a sword (or two-handed sword like the *zweihänder*) had in battle against armoured opponents, I cannot say. Someone more with more knowledge than I can probably give a good answer as to what they were used for and the techniques/strategies revolving around them.	human
756	"&gt; First, I don't think people who like historical fiction have to justify liking it. Some people are really into this stuff.    Forgive me, but I have never disputed that. In fact I accept the idea that it is the player's right to like the game for their own reasons.   &gt; Yes, games set in fictionalized historical settings deviate from those settings in order to create gameplay. No, this does not mean that you've broken verisimilitude so anything goes now.    That's in fact my point: that verisimilitude exists for the game's sake. To make the game more ""immersive"" for the players - in any way that improves the player's experience of the game. Not for historical accuracy, not to provide a recreation of a true environment, unless this is what the player wants. But as the average player is not a historian, those things he demands are not historical accuracy but faithfulness to their own expectations - the ability to meet their expectations improves the game experience, in the same way the presence or absence of black characters may do. When I play a war simulator I expect to be able to create an army, develop a strategy, eventually vanquish my enemy - I do not expect an accurate representation of war.   I appreciate that, as games evolve, there is a push to include themes of equality, diversity, etc. But I believe those themes to be a reflection of us - the players - non the in game world, which is ultimately created by us.   &gt; Try replacing every instance of ""black people"" in the above arguments with ""cowboys.""   I could. What game wouldn't be improved by having cowboys in it? But I assume many others wouldn't like it.   I think it's the same thing: being bothered by the gameplay, controls, combat dynamics, plot twists, poor dialogue, environment, characters, skin tone, cowboys in XV Century Europe. It's the player's prerogative. But I can't see how it becomes an issue of historical accuracy.   &gt;  I see a massive difference between arguing for the inclusion of black or dark skinned characters on the grounds of realism or historical plausibility, versus arguing that there's no excuse for not including them once you've fictionalized the setting in some other way. I only object to the latter argument.   And I think you have the right to object, and to ask for entertainment that meets your expectations. But so does anyone else, including those who want black characters in the game, as long as it does not detract from their game experience. It's an issue of what the player wants and, maybe, if the game should always give the player what he thinks he wants - personally I'd love to see a game take an unorthodox approach to verisimilitude by challenging what's expected. And I don't think there is a ""once"": the game setting is always fictional.   &gt; I think you might have an easier time seeing more clearly on the subject if you allowed yourself to consider a non political issue, where you don't look down upon the people who are on the other side.   I really don't.   But I think we should question our approach to games, because games - unlike other media - actually give us the time and space to do so in game. I don't know if finding a black character where I didn't expect them to be would change my game experience for better or worse but it might give me a moment to think about my own agency in the game."	human

762	"Landsat Island – a name bestowed by the Canadian Board of Geographical Names, and a discussion of which by u/Hazeltin is linked to elsewhere in this thread – does seem to be the sole recognised landmass, other than volcanic new islands such as [Surtsey,](http://earthsky.org/earth/surtsey-and-the-birth-of-new-islands) off the coast of Iceland to have actually been discovered by satellite imaging. Actually, referring to it as a landmass is a bit of a stretch – it measures 50 yards by 25 and stands about 35 feet clear of the surface of the North Atlantic eight miles east of House Island, off the coast of Labrador.  But it's also worth noting that the simple fact that satellites exist has not definitely settled the question of whether other small islands may not still exist undiscovered. Most satellite cameras are pointed at known civil and military targets, and those that do scan the oceans produce millions of images that have still never been comprehensively scrutinised for what they may reveal.  Indeed, at least one other potential discovery which postdate Sputnik but has yet to clear the bar in terms of general recognition occurred in 1979 in the southern Indian Ocean, where a US aircraft carrier group reported the discovery of a new reef 9 miles east of Diego Garcia. The discovery was confirmed in multiple ways at the time – visually from the ships in the group, by helicopter, and by both fathomometer and leadline – and the admiral insisted on it, but two subsequent searches by professional hydrography teams failed to confirm it.  Perhaps just as interesting, however, is the long-running presence on nautical charts of a plethora of ""doubtful islands"", marked with the notation ""E.D."" (""existence doubtful"") or P,D. (""position doubtful""), several of which have been sighted and charted on several different occasions, but the existence of which cannot now be confirmed by modern technology.   The most famous of these doubtful landmasses are probably the Auroras, in the South Atlantic, a group of three supposed islands originally discovered by the crew of a ship of that name in 1762, rediscovered in 1790, and professionally surveyed in 1794 by the Spanish survey vessel *Atrevida*. No sign of these islands has been reported since. Much the same can be said of the mysterious Thompson Island, supposedly a small, low-lying mass located to the north east of [Bouvet Island,](https://mikedashhistory.com/2011/02/13/an-abandoned-lifeboat-at-worlds-end/) sighted in 1825 and sporadically thereafter until 1893, which features heavily in the 1962 novel *A Grue of Ice*, by Geoffrey Jenkins. Whether these islands ever existed, but were destroyed by volcanic activity, or whether they were actually large icebergs, remains a matter of dispute.  Not all such doubtful islands have been reported anywhere near the poles, however. The most recent notable case involves an island known as Bermeja, in the Caribbean off the Yucatan peninsula, which appeared on maps from the 1500s and was charted by Mexico in 1941. Air-sea searches conducted early in this century failed to confirm its existence. Campbell, writing in 2009, reports that as of that date Bermuja's co-ordinates still appeared in the CIA world handbook and on Google Earth, but a search for Bermuja in that year failed to reveal any trace of the island – a matter of some importance to the Mexicans, since confirmation of its existence would extend their territorial waters by about 55 miles in a region known to be rich in mineral wealth.  One final point is that doubts about many of these islands persisted largely because they were so far off normal shipping lanes. Gould makes the point that the Belcher Islands, in Hudson's Bay – some of which are 70 miles long and almost within sight of the mainland – were not discovered until 1915, even though the Bay itself had been known to Europeans and regularly traversed ever since 1610, simply because they were not on any shipping lane.  **Sources**  Matthew Campbell, ""Oil boom fuels mystery of the missing island,"" *Sunday Times* 6 September 2009  Rupert Gould, ""The Auroras, and other doubtful islands"", in *Oddities: A Book of Unexplained Facts* (1929)  Henry Stommel, *Lost Islands: The Story of Islands That Have Vanished from Nautical Charts* (1984)"	human

770	Genocide is an overblown term for the witch hunts, it was not that massive. People calling it a genocide comes from the belief that roughly 9 million people were killed in a short amount of time. When in fact it was actually around 1 million in a span of 500 years between 1200 to 1700.   In terms of witchcraft, or what people accused other people of, there's basically a broad range. The Salem triles document that some people accused of being a witch could talk to the dead, enter people's dreams and were of course unchristian. In fact that was basically the idea of what witchcraft was, anything that went against the church. Often people who were taken in by the church were taken for political reasons and accused of being a witch not long after. Between 1200 to 1700 a lot of historians think that it's really in response to fear about war or economic trouble. As well as some people accusing others they didn't like of being witches. When there is a general fear in a society people will take that fear out on someone in order to make themselves feel better. The witch hunts were a way of control and making sure that they could take down a literal evil that they thought was the problem. By no means is this right or justifies their actions but it explains them. 	human

778	That's pretty much it! They turn up in both *Foul Bodies: Cleanliness in Early America* and *Behind Closed Doors: At Home in Georgian England*.

779	Yes and no. Yes, the first block printing press was invented in and used during the Tang or Song Dynasty. No because even though block printing was invented in China, it wasn’t often used outside of the government.

The printing method in which you are probably imagining (similar to Gutenberg's printing press) is the concept of movable type. This was invented by a man named Pi Sheng, who held no official government title or position, between 1041 and 1048. Another notable person who worked as a printer was Wang Chen, whose collection explained and displayed why movable type never took off in China: he had over tens of thousands of wooden type characters. In fact, in order to print a local gazetteer, 60,000 wooden type characters were needed. It was simply too laborious to efficiently use movable type for a language such as Chinese.

787	"The dominant image of late medieval and Early Modern witch hunt lore is of the accused as exclusively women, targeted for being women, and of the accusations as having an intensely gendered and sexual cast to them linking women's witchcraft to women's lust. This perception has been generously helped along by the relative accessibility of Heinrich Kramer's *Malleus Maleficarum*, which does have an unmistakably nasty set of descriptions of who women witches are and what they do. However, Kramer is a single 15th century German commentator (albeit one whose works were broadly available -- there's [a kickass thread about just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7qb9p5/for_centuries_the_malleus_maleficarum_was_second/) by /u/AncientHistory) and is not representative of witch-hunt proceedings in another place and time. Male witches were prosecuted across Europe and in some locations were even treated as the primary phenomenon of witchcraft -- a ""typical"" witch in 16th century Normandy might be a male, teenaged shepherd who stole consecrated Hosts from a Catholic church in order to use them for mysterious sinister purposes or a male adulterer who used a magic mirror to find hidden objects. In 17th century Iceland he might be an adult man found to possess questionable artifacts (books of spells, other witchcraft tools) which he used to bring misfortune on his neighbors. In each place and time the physical trappings of witchcraft differ, and so does the belief whether persons practicing witchcraft necessarily had direct interactions with devils (obviously out of line for any Christian) or erred in seeking means outside Church-sanctioned venues to try to affect good or bad changes. Due to the structures of medieval/Early Modern societies, marginalized people (including women) might have been more inclined to seek recourse outside legally and religiously approved means. But not such these means provoked punishment, or were seen as full-blown, 70s-British-horror-movie-style witchcraft. Are you interested in the physical elements of witchcraft in this period (physical tools of witchcraft, the physical effects witches were said to bring about or inflict on others) or more in the philosophical and religious ideas that made witchcraft seem so threatening?    I don't think it's founded for later writers to compare such persecutions to organized persecutions on the sole basis of a stigmatized identity, like the exercises of hostility toward Jewish communities in this era. There might have also been ulterior motives like profit or local politics in those persecutions, as in witchcraft accusations and witch-trials, but the motivation there was first and foremost a hatred of a stigmatized group and I confess my hackles rise at some comparisons that routinely come up in casual discussions of the topic. (Whether that's treating a witch-trial in 17th century Salem, MA as mutually interchangeable with a witch-trial in 14th century Essex or 16th century Normandy, or invoking the ""Burning Times"", or comparisons to the Holocaust, or treating a 15th century European Catholic's idea of witchcraft as synonymous with the religious practices of a mid-20th-century or modern-day neo-pagan's. There's a lot about this topic that gets my goat.) Witch-hunts weren't the primary venue of gendered hostility in the late medieval and Early Modern era, or even necessarily a primary one, but part of why witch-hunt lore and literature makes a good venue for exploring contemporary ideas about gender is that those elements are often pretty close to the surface in historical writings rather than buried in archaeological data or court records. Even many thinkers and organizations that were hardly on the cutting-edge of Early Modern feminist thought, like the Spanish Inquisition and many of Kramer's own contemporaries, doubted the existence of efficacious witchcraft altogether -- Satan might be at work under these circumstances, but only in the form of ugly superstitions and deluding self-professed ""witches"" into thinking they made ointments out of babies or had the power to sicken others. Others were not nearly so focused on the figure of the female witch as Kramer and co., returning to the earlier figure of the sorcerer who affects changes in the world around him through books rather than through ointments and spells or through direct congress with the Devil. Other individuals fervently interested in witchcraft as a phenomenon, like King James I of England, encountered cases that were undeniably fraudulent and due to local grudges and hoaxing and acknowledged these cases as such. So it wasn't a universally credulous group of thinkers, or universally obsessed with witches' teats and the Devil's icy jizz, but even from these skeptical accounts and refutations you can gather a good idea of what people thought witches were capable of doing, and what true-believer types thought the purpose of witchcraft was.  A lot of pop history and mainstream conceptions of witch-hunting are skewed by 19th and 20th century scholarship that was working not from case studies or from legal records but pretty much from the *Malleus Maleficarum* alone. (Often in English translation, which makes less legible some of the gendered distinctions of a Latin text.) Misogyny is as inextricable from witch-hunt literature as it is from any form of secular legal writing in this fairly-broad window of time, but the construction of ""medieval witch hunts"" as a single monolithic genocide of women whose only crime was being wise old midwives practicing hedge-witchery and subsequently being burned at the stake is not good history. (Especially the midwife thing -- far from being the central targets of male hostility, midwives are often cited in witchcraft-related writing to back up the strength of an assertion about the accused person's body without violating decorum by suggesting a male examiner took a look at the accused himself, or to verify that a physical abnormality on a female witch wasn't within the scope of natural variation.)   Some sources -- these skew toward the question of male witches because I was writing something about them recently, but there's a lot of good scholarship about witch hunts broadly and in specific out there. I'm not a scholar of femicides, so I can't help anyone there, but I'm interested in Early Modern religion and witchcraft.  - ""Toads and Eucharists: The Male Witches Of Normandy, 1564-1660"", William Monter - Male Witches In Early Modern Europe, Lara Apps and Andrew Gow - ""Balthasar Bekker and the Decline of the Witch-Craze: The Old Demonology And The New Philosophy"" by Robin Attfield - ""Historians as Demonologists: The Myth of the Midwife-witch"" by David Harley  - *The Malleus Maleficarum and the construction of witchcraft* by Hans Peter Broedel  - *Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A regional and comparative study* by Alan McFarlane - *European Witchcraft* by E. William Monter (this has a great section, ""The Great Witchcraft Debate, 1560-1580"", covering Johann Weyer's *De Praestigiis Daemonum* and its assertions that accused witches are really just sick, addled, or confused and that earnest belief in witchcraft's power is a disgrace to Christian faith -- not that there's no whiff of misogyny about his argument describing some self-professed witches as ""miserable little women, crazed by the Devil"" into believing that they can fly) "	human
788	For Spain, it could be useful the diary of Girolamo da Sommaia. He was a student in Salamanca between 1603 and 1607. In his diary, he records everything you can imagine: the price of goods and services (meat, bread, theatre tickets, prostitutes, you name it), life in Salamanca, student life, a complete inventory of the theatrical plays that he watched (a lot of them), the books he read, religious services...   I don't know if there is an English translation. I only know the Spanish edition.   Sommaia, Girolamo da, *Diario de un estudiante de Salamanca*, edition by George Haley.

791	Yes, actually, it is true that the early Chinese (Zhou, Qin, and Han Dynasties) invented printing. They also invented paper (or a type of it), the compass, and porcelain, among other things. The main reason that their version of printing didn’t spread to Europe is because the only communication to Europe at this time was the Silk Road (connections to the Indus River Valley civilizations, and the Roman Empire), and it would often take years to traverse that measure of distance (roughly 7000 kilometers!). It’s likely that Chinese version of printing was only acquired by the rich of early Eurasian civilizations due to this, and thus not adopted as a practical solution.	human
792	The reason why Gutenberg gets the credit is that he had a combination of technologies in the same time and the right place:  * Linen paper, not vellum, which was cheaper to make and easier to handle * Easily replicable type, that is, once they had one letter they could copy it to have many identical letters * The Roman alphabet instead of the Chinese character system * Of course, the Gutenberg Press itself   Source: [Stephen Fry and the Gutenberg Press (BBC, 2009)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009wynj) 	human
793	"So everyone just took 'people' to mean, ""people of European descent,"" and that didn't raise any eyebrows? So much so that this excellent, comprehensive response dealt with white people's clothing habits - not dealing with say, Indians or Chinese people at all, and it just slipped smoothly by?

797	Suspicions. I just wanted suspicions.  The thing is, it seems *too* suspicious that he gives the order to have fires light up the peaks and then... oh look fire in the temple of the mighty Earthshaker. Something like that, but if you truly don't feel able to speculate, just leave the question, I was actually almost deleting this last night, the coincidence XD.  Well why would Agesilaos do it? Maybe a warning? Maybe a propaganda that the Athenians attack and the temple is burning, so clearly is a sign that they are against divine order? I don't know, my soul feeds on professional speculation so any minimally plausible suggestion is welcome. I read that part and it seemed so highly suspicious that just when they were lighting the fires as in any other place at any other time happens, the temple lights up, and the fact that the Spartan troops seemed to be very distressed until the lights come up, and then the temple burns, there is also Agesilaos incidence at Aulis to consider (though I know that would be more in the line of he having celebrated the Isthmian games while it was actually the Corinthian who should and did shortly after, but I gotta admit, it sounds interesting. And does Xenophon need to know everything? He clearly seems to believe *someone* did it, and not on accident, so why not? Or might it have been done by some anti-Spartan Corinthian? or might it be actually a simple accident and Xenophon never knew? There is the burning of the temple of Athena Aphaia to consider as precedent. And I don't have a line of thinking, I have thoughts, I throw them out and whoever wants a grab and make a line out of it, have it xD)	human

799	Followup to the followup: is there a list of camp slang? And/or a book that discusses the slang in depth?	human
800	But I had it understood that the rules are precisely that answers must be in-depth, sourced, and precisely in the past the wiki has been *specifically dismissed* as a useful source.

I really just wanted to cut the need for a mod to say that, but if I really give the wrong impression, I won't do it any longer and leave that work for the mods.	human
801	To clarify- I am specifically referring to the movable type printing press. There were some even simpler presses designed as early as the first century AD in the Roman Empire.  Yes, the Chinese invented movable type long before the Europeans - in around 1000 AD, during the Song Dynasty, as compared to Gutenberg’s invention in the early 1400s. The basic reason why it didn’t catch on in China was their lack of an alphabet. Written Chinese has a different symbol for every word, whereas most European languages have alphabets. Because Chinese had so many symbols, the movable type printing press did not save time or make it more efficient to print text. It remained a novelty and never gained much traction until it reached the West.	human
802	You might find *Selected English Letters* by Mabel Duckitt and Harriet Wragg of interest. It's an anthology of letters by various people from the 17th through the 19th century. While most of the letter writers are at a minimum marginally notable, they write about all sorts of mundane things. A print form of the book is available in many libraries, and it's also in the public domain and available free in its entirety online at [Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/12515/pg12515-images.html) and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/selectedenglishl00duckiala).	human
803	Gutenberg was the first person to make moveable type especially with metal (were each letter could be moved and replaced) printing as we know in western Europe. But wood block printing (you carve an entire design on wood) had existed for several centuries before in Europe and for millennia in India. While in China the were actively using wood block printing for even longer (due to government standardisation of official exams), especially for name seals which was one character usually. That being said the practice of having entirely printed books using wood blocks was a norm but was extremely laborious and you had to carve every single characters negative on the block. But people actively took short cuts and cut out the most popular characters and reused them on the blocks. Then some time later some print makers used durable ceramic characters for the common characters and carved the rest on woodblocks.  But the first true consistent movable type printers come from Korea in the 1300s. Since they used Chinese characters in a limited fashion. Used the most popular characters to print entire books without writing everything out for each block of each page. They just reused those few metal characters page by page.   Though it's said that a brought of missionaries saw this tech and brought the ideas back. Since like 100 years after the Korean one is when Gutenberg invented his system. Though it very unlikely he knew or heard about anything else like his own machine. And his machine was based more on a wine press than anything else so there's that. So I think it's more a parallel evolution of independent ideas.  Source: I work in a print shop with a very enthusiastic boss who loved history.	human
804	Even though Wikipedia is frowned upon as a source within this subreddit, it's still a great place to check for context before posting here! The [article on the printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) provides the basic timeline, notably that first printing press with movable type was invented in East Asia in 1234, several hundred years before Gutenberg. For sources, the article provides Joseph Needham's book [Paper and Printing](https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx-9mS6Aa4wC&amp;q=1234#v=snippet&amp;q=1234&amp;f=false), which indicates that wooden-type printing presses preceded the metal versions by multiple centuries.   Looking forward to the additional information regarding why this development did not spread further!	human
805	It's seemingly a parallel evolution of ideas. Since it's unlikely Gutenberg even heard about Korea 100 years before him. Or got a detailed description of the workings of their system. Print makers in Europe were using wood blocks for art and mass producing simple text, Same as China and Korea. so it seems like the principal makers simply got pragmatic about how laborious it would be to make full books so. They recycled pieces that made things easy and as soon as they could get movable type working, the durability of wood was a problem so they switched to metal pieces for letters. So they could use less resources and time to make more. A logical evolution. 	human
806	"Clemence, princess of Hungary, set sail from Naples to the coast of France in 1315, where she was to marry King Louis X. Marriage could be a daunting prospect for an elite royal or noblewoman in the best of circumstances, but this was far from ideal. Clemence's parents were long dead, and her brother would travel the opposite direction to claim the Hungarian crown. The French crown was deep in debt; the king earned the sobriquet ""the Quarreler."" Clemence wasn't his first queen, either. The previous year, Margaret of Burgundy had been accused and convicted of adultery in a massive three-way scandal at the French royal court. Adultery did not justify divorce in medieval Europe, to be sure...but she had quickly died in prison under suspicious circumstances. To top it all off, Clemence's ship wrecked off the coast of Marseilles. She kept her life but lost all her possessions.  So, chronicler Geoffrey of Paris laments, the royal wedding was a somber and subdued affair. Louis and Clemence couldn't muster a guest list worth recording, and--horrors--there wasn't even any dancing. At the wedding of Clemence and Louis, the most important menu item for any noble attending was to stay out of the way.  I'm starting with that to make a point, of course. A medieval wedding, even at the royal level, was still a wedding and still made a marriage even absent the ceremony and shows of power. This is not an age where spectacle was the same as substance. But fear not: spectacle still mattered, and if you got your idea of a medieval wedding from *Game of Thrones*, you still haven't seen anything yet.  In 1369, a Dutch princess was probably dreading her own wedding, or ""wedding."" Katherine of Bavaria and Holland was only nine years old, but her father was very very invested in the marriage he had arranged for her with a Low Countries prince, Edward, duke of Guelders and count of Zutphen. To celebrate, he hosted three afternoon-evenings' worth of feast: a three-course dinner, a four-course dinner, and a five-course dinner...plus the three (or more) courses that followed each one, plus the preceding and intervening courses that were not even meant to be eaten. The normal flow of events for multi-day feasts, including weddings, was to feature entertainment and religious events surrounding the dinner parties. Tournaments are the most notable, but this could range from a formal event to the brother of the duke setting up camp in the city's largest marketplace to challenge all comers.  The surviving abbreviated ""menu notes"" that survive from this wedding (rare for the 14th century and earlier) show what was important about the courses: meat, meat, and more meat. Each course featured multiple dishes of different meat (or cheese), with no attention to modern ideas of the salad course, the soup course, the appetizer, the entree. Two important patterns are the use of spices and the predominance of sour flavors. In particular, the budget paid for a *lot* of saffron--the rare spice in that it was actually grown in Europe rather than imported from ""the East,"" but the difficulty of cultivation made it among the most costly...therefore the most prestigious.  Some of the menu items where it's possible to reconstruct what is meant by the recipe (sometimes it just says, essentially, ""deer"") include:  * *Lucfriyte*, one of the dishes served after the formal meal, was fried soft cheese mixed with butter, eggs, sugar, and salt, and then baked inside a pastry shell * *Mameny*, a dish whose broth was made from quinces cooked in wine with lots of spices, ground almonds, and enough pheasant meat to turn it from a soup into a solid you could cut with a knife * Deer served with a thick cream-of-wheat style porridge containing wheat, milk, egg yolks, and spices * Many courses cooked into jelly or served surrounded by gelatin/aspic. (Medieval Netherlands, the U.S. Midwest called; it wants its potluck back.)  In the course of dining, the major courses would be served to guests at tables. The extra courses were known then as a *banquet*. They were actually laid out for the guests to come and take at their choosing. This tells us something of the order of the evening: even after the meal proper was finished, people were expected/required to stick around for talking and, yes, dancing.  And then there were the *entremets*.  These were...let's call them *food-based* courses meant for display and awe rather than consumption. I've talked before on AH about the musicians who played for the crowd *baked into a pie crust* and the wine dispenser shaped like a naked woman. For his daughter's wedding, Duke Albert made sure to go one better than the traditional ""pig with an apple in its mouth"" display. On each night, guests were greeted with a displayed boar that *breathed fire.*   Gold and silver plates, gold and silver tapestries were the order of the day for decorations at many famous feasts; indeed, that's the stereotypical background in satirical romances and poems. Some guests might supply display items as part of their gift, it seems. More frequently, of course, prestigious material goods meant for show were passed on. A popular gift, believe it or not, was crowns--hardly an exclusive prerogative of the king. In at least one French royal wedding, the chronicler makes special note of a lavish bed as a gift. This was popular among the urban bourgeoisie--the family bed was frequently bequeathed to the oldest daughter on her wedding, at least in Germany--but evidently this was at least sometimes the case at the most elite level as well. Rings, necklaces, jewels of any sort were also popular gifts fit for a queen and king.  As far as festivities go, we need to leave behind the boars that breathed fire and take a look at a different sort of experience of fire. The so-called ""Bal des Ardents"" in 1393 was actually a wedding feast at the French royal court, albeit celebrating the remarriage of the queen's lady-in-waiting Catherine de Fastaverin, not Isabeau herself. The party during and after the meal included ""performances"" amidst the dancing, and one ill-fated performance in particular has given the event its name.  A group of six dancers disguised themselves as tree-men/brutes, smearing their faces and clothing with thick resin and sticking flax and linen strips everywhere. Wild men, they were wild! They ran about the hall yelling and whooping and ""dancing"" like devils. They taunted the audience--guess who we are!  ...And then they caught fire.   It might have been a drunken accident, it might have been deliberate; either way, it was even worse than you think, because *the king was one of the dancers.*  In the end, only two of the six men survived: the king, fortunately or unfortunately, by starving his costume of oxygen fuel by smothering himself under the Duchess of Berry's skirts; and one of his knights, who jumped into a giant tub of wine.  So we can add something else to your list of do's and don'ts: *Don't* carry a burning torch into the middle of a raucous party when the use of torches has been explicitly forbidden.  But if you really, *really* want the goods on a fancy medieval wedding, you need to pack up your brocaded skirts and crimson-covered wagons and transport yourself to the stylish, elite world of Renaissance Italy, and specifically, the spring 1475 wedding of Camilla d'Aragona and Constanzo Sforza in Pesaro.  First of all, Camilla's *entire entourage*, paid for by her uncle (coincidentally the king of Aragon), was a wedding gift for the new couple. And that entourage couldn't even get into the city before the festivities started. It was greeted outside the gates by a large ""hunting party"" bearing gifts of game and accompanied by 13 actors dressed as classical nymphs and goddesses. Children dressed as fairies waved olive branches as she processed to the castle, which had already become a world of dancing and bonfires and shouting.  And she got to do the splashy entry all over again the next day following a tour of the city, except it was even more lavish.  I honestly don't know how to sum up the splendor and spectacle of this wedding; a contemporary account of the whole affair has been published as *A Renaissance Wedding*, and it's just breathtaking to read. With Europe stretching out its imperialist fingers, sugar and citrus fruits were a big-ticket item. There is just course after course of sugared limes, and dishes cooked in sugar and wine, and sugar sculpted into the shape of castles. And there was gold: ""gilded, star-shaped jellies. Gilded pine-seed cakes shaped like lilies. Gilded wing-shaped pastries. Gilded pine-seed cakes weighing half a pound each.  On the day of the wedding itself, the *twelve* courses were each presented by hired actors dressed as the Sun, Moon, and Greek gods.  And yes, with the whole affair ""hosted"" by the Sun and Moon, the hall was decorated appropriately:  &gt; The hall...was completely canopied in azure blue cloth. At the centre across the full width of the room was a zodiac with all its degrees marked in silver, and within it, the twelve heavenly signs in gold, each exactly the size of a man. They were attached with their associated stars...and these stars were all made of mirrors surround by silver rays...There were five planets made from large mirrors with many rays, chiefly gold and silver.  And yes, the Sun and Moon made their entrance through trapdoors in the ceiling, surrounded by candles and torches and ""clouds"" of gold or silver fabric:  &gt; At a given signal...a circular door opened showing a scintillating paradise of gold and silver and glittering lights, through which the golden Sun and silver Moon descended...And when either descended, lutes, cymbals, harps, and other instruments could be heard playing above in sweetest harmony.  Below the celestial vista, the hall's walls were lined with fruit trees, tapestries, and the duke's coats of arms. In gold, of course.  And that's to say nothing about the fireworks."	human
807	Oh boy, finally something I can answer on this sub  It is true that printing itself was invented by the chinese back in the 8th century.  But their version was pretty basic and could only be used for very simple forms and a couple of different materials. What they invented was called relief printing which was basically engraving a simple negative illustration into wax- or woodblock, putting paint on the parts that weren't cut-out and pressing that stamp onto paper or clay or whatever you wanted to print on. After removing the stamp the colour would stick onto the surface of your printed material and voilà: that was your print.  You can imaging that it was extremly time consuming to engrave every single stamp by hand, so that printing a paper with text was a rare occurence. Printing a whole book with this method would probably even take more time than just writing it. (Sidenote: Writing was the only way of creating books until printing bevame easier thanks to gutenberg)  And that is where Gutenberg comes into play. He invented moveable metal letters in the 15th cenutry. So instead of engraving a whole page by hand you would create just one small letter per printing-form. And instead of cutting them into wood, you would mold them into metal.  Here is a picture of such a letter for easier understanding: http://www.typografie.info/3/uploads/monthly_01_2013/ccs-1-0-61525400-1359188546_thumb.jpg  So after creating several printing forms of every letter you could arrange them into every possible order, forming words, sentences and whole pages. This invention made it relatively easy to create books and soon spread all over europe and later all over the world.  This stayed the most important book-printing process until the 1970's when easier printing processes became available and is nowadays considered outdated.

810	&gt; This expropriation and redistribution system grew larger and more sophisticated as the camp system evolved.  I've read a fair bit about wartime Germany but never saw any mention of how seized shoes, clothing, and other personal essentials like prosthetics were distributed. Were they sold in used clothing/thrift shops? Or were they distributed in clothing/shoe banks?  A Philip Kerr novel I read mentioned that clothing seized in camps was distributed to war widows and those who lost their homes due to bombing. I've read that Kerr is fairly historically accurate, but I didn't know if this particular detail was something actual or from his imagination.	human

814	&gt; But what really set Gutenberg apart from his predecessors in Asia was his development of a press that mechanized the transfer of ink from movable type to paper. Adapting the screw mechanisms found in wine presses, papermakers' presses and linen presses, Gutenberg developed a press perfectly suited for printing. The first printing press allowed for an assembly line-style production process that was much more efficient than pressing paper to ink by hand. For the first time in history, books could be mass-produced — and at a fraction of the cost of conventional printing methods.  https://www.livescience.com/43639-who-invented-the-printing-press.html	human
815	Yes, it's true that China had printing before Johannes Gutenberg, and by almost one thousand years. Printing started in China in 593 (A.D.) to print Buddhist texts. Keep in mind that this method of printing was not moveable type but rather a collection of stamp-like wood carvings that pressed directly on the paper, but even moveable type printing was invented in China before Gutenberg. Bi Sheng developed a moveable printing press at around 1030-1040 (A.D.). Other methods developed throughout Chinese history and have spread to other parts of Asia, and these methods of printing, although different to European methods, were as advanced. So why do history teachers credit Gutenberg for the invention? It may very well be because of Euro-centrism, but it also could be because of the nature of Latin/Germanic languages compared to various Chinese dialects. The Roman alphabet is only 26 characters, while Chinese has a character for every word; printing in European languages was a lot easier even with the methods the Chinese used to combat these limitations.	human
816	"In short, no, no sword of any type can cut or slice through plate armor, and piercing is exceedingly unlikely.  To see how two-handed swords were used when fighting in harness, we do have some, well, instruction manuals. With the earliest examples dating to around 1300 (for the M.S. i.33 ""Walpurgis"" manuscript showing unarmored sword-and-buckler fencing), and really hitting their stride in the 15th-16th centuries, we have a number of period fighting manuals. These are treatises, many illustrated, written by professional fencing masters for the benefit their students and patrons.   A number of these from the late 14th century onward include sections on fighting in armor with and against various weapons, often in a judicial duel context.   For our purposes, let's look at the examples given by Fiore Furlano de'i Liberi (c. 1340 - c. 1420) in his work ""The Flower of Battle"" dating to around 1404 and by Hans Talhoffer (c. 1410 - c. 1482) in his ""fechtbuch"" (lit. ""fight book"") from the mid 1440s.    Both of these gentlemen include a segment in their respective manuscripts a section on fighting in full armor with two-handed swords. In both cases, the response is not to go *through* the armor, but *around* the armor. They make extensive, almost exclusive, use of what the Germans like Talhoffer termed ""Halbschwert"" (lit. ""half-swording""), where a combatant grips the blade of his own sword partway down its length. This essentially ""chokes up"" on the sword, and one would then use it more like a short spear or polearm to press and hook and maneuver the opponent and the weapon to guide the tip around the plate armor and into a more vulnerable point, such as the eyeslit, armpit, or groin. Especially in the German schools, a fight in armor seems to degenerate into an armored wrestling match (and it is no accident both Fiore and Talhoffer, as well as others, include extensive sections on wrestling). The Germans even called it ""Ringen-am-Schwert"" (""wrestling with swords"").   Now, could a two-handed sword *damage* plate armor? Maybe, depending on what one means by ""damage"". There is a half-swording technique--Tallhoffer calls it the ""Mordschlag"" (""Murder stroke"") where one grips the blade of the sword with both hands and, with a powerful overhead strike, uses the hilt of the sword like a hammerhead to bash an opponent on their head. Weather this would severely dent or damage the helm is going to be dependent on the helm, but it would certainly rattle if not stun the guy inside, allowing for followup techniques.  Now, on to the second part of your question: if a sword couldn't cut or pierce through plate armor, what use was it on the battlefield? Setting aside that most period ""fighting manuals"" seem to be more geared towards duels and judicial combat, one thing to consider is that, even at its height, full plate armor was not employed by everyone on the battlefield. Full plate harness is expensive, and was the purview of those rich enough to afford it. Many, if not the vast majority, of the enemies our hypothetical 15th-century knight is going to encounter on the battlefield are not going be wearing full plate.   Furthermore, you ask more specifically about a ""Zweihander""  type of two-handed sword. Now, what is and is not a ""zweihander"" vs a longsword is a distinction that largely only exists in our modern sensibilities. However, large two-handed swords most commonly associated with the Zweihander (also called a ""Bidenhander"" or ""Dopplehander"", all meaning the same thing--""two-hander"") type hit their stride really mostly in the first half of the 1500s. They were used on the battlefield in an era where full plate was on its way out beyond ceremonial and tournament use. Formations of pikes supported by archers and firearms. Zweihander wielders fought along-side these pike blocks. They were particularly known to be used by certain members of influential mercenary companies particularly among the Landsknechts. (side note: popular histories will tell you that Doppelsöldners, those Landsknechts who received double-pay, used zweihanders. Whereas zweihander users were entitled double-pay and thus were doppelsöldners, not all doppelsöldners used zweihanders. A doppelsöldner was a volunteer who was placed in important and dangerous positions in the formation, such as the front line). It is said that zweihanders were used to disrupt enemy pike formations. Whether that was the case or not, as well as how they would go about that, is debatable."	human

819	"Gutenberg invented the technique of making injectable molds for reuseable individual letter-casts, a technological innovation. However, the real ""in the air"" wasn't technological or even scientific: it was *literary*.  There's a reason the movable-type printing press was invented in Germany in the 15th century: it was basically the first time that mass production of books was a viable business strategy. That is, it was the first time someone could make 300 copies of a Latin tome or 1000 certificates of indulgence and *expect* that they would sell 300 copies of that Latin tome or 1000 certificates of indulgence. (N.b.: the latter would be sold as profane objects to a bishop or pilgrimate site, who would then distribute them as theological promises to Christians who earned them).  Gutenberg came up with injectable letter-molds; he did not come up with the idea of mass production of books. The actual printing press itself was already in use. But the plates were made of carved wood, and each page of a book needed its own full wooden plate, and even the plates themselves didn't last very long with the ink soaking into the wood and eventually wearing it away.  Furthermore, also a cultural innovation, there was the new need to develop a marketing strategy to make sure you *could* sell those 300 Latin tomes. From the 1420s, a few enterprising manuscript workshop owners set up almost ""assembly line"" manuscript production, the same text in multiple copies back to back so layout, paper-cutting, and decoration were all ready to go with different scribes working on different parts. What they had to figure out was how to make sure they could have demand for their supply. Before that, all manuscript production was *on demand*: the buyer special-ordered the text.  One of the first strategies was, of course, networking. Scribe workshop owners wrote letters to churches and universities and patricians and notaries saying ""Would you be interested in this text?"" The idea of a bookshop was still in the future.  So whether or not there was an ""injectable mold arms race,"" Johannes Gutenberg was hardly the only person thinking about the overall promises and challenges of book mass production."	human
820	This is a good reply! The only thing I would add is that Europeans had been using block printing for awhile, the idea of wooden block printing and movable type were known to Europeans before Gutenberg—in fact, some enterprising individuals used wooden block printing to create playing cards in the 1200s and 1300s. So why didn't one of them make the logical leap to printing books? After all, there was a large market for books!    Like today, students attending university would have to get copies of the books assigned by the professor. Like today, these books would be absurdly expensive and burdensome. Like today, there was also a market for graduating seniors to sell their secondhand books to incoming freshmen. However, unlike today, the books were not printed with highly efficient printing presses and at huge profit margins. Instead, the books were so expensive because each copy was produced by a scribe who would write and illustrate the books by hand. Modern academic publishers have no such excuse. As a result, in cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence and Rome, there were a great number of competing scribes, which had the effect of keeping the prices (relatively) reasonable. Along came a little rat called the Black Death—which hit the urban areas occupied by scribes the hardest—and prices shot up. To make things worse for the destitute students, literacy was becoming increasingly common as every wealthy lady or man clamored for their own copies of religious and romantic texts written in the vernacular (the common tongue, such as English, French, or German), thus straining the scribal output to the breaking point.  (These two paragraphs were taken from my book) 	human
821	"&gt; but it sounds like they knew the way it ""just was"" didn't match up to how they could see it being?  To chime in here and challenge this notion a bit: first of all, the day-to-day experience we have of the celestial motions very much favours a geocentric worldview; we don't 'feel' the earth moving, and the sky sure looks like a dome surrounding us.  Furthermore, the pre-modern notion of motion and space were fundamentally different from how we now look at those things, which also significantly complicated the move from geocentrism to heliocentrism. To give an example they were struggling with at the time: all matter has a natural inclination towards its natural place in the universe. Earth seeks earth, and moves towards the center, water seeks water, air seeks air, fire seeks fire. This explains the natural locomotion of elements. So \*if\* the air is *really* moving around the center of the universe, what happens to the atmosphere? Does it fall down towards the sun? And if I throw a stone up in the air, does it fall away from the earth towards the center of the solar system? If not, and if instead it seeks the center of our planet, then why? What is directing this motion? And what would happen if I would take all the earth and all the water, and move it all away from the center of our planet? Would it still move towards this now empty and fictitious center? Or would it conglomerate at a different position?   All of the alternatives to the Aristotelian physics sounded absurd to these people, and they had good reasons to be skeptical about such alternatives. Hindsight is not only 20/20, but nowadays it is extremely difficult to comprehend the worldview they were dealing with.  This exact problem, of understanding the resistance to the Copernican revolution, is what supposedly caused Kuhn to invent the notion of paradigms and incommensurable frameworks; the Aristotelians were literally in a different worldview - they were asking different questions and were trying to solve different problems, they used different meanings and different concepts, etc. Trying to understand their way of thinking requires a lot of study and open-mindedness.  So it wasn't at all apparent to them that their established theory 'didn't match up' - not until much later. Especially also because many of the great new discoveries were made with telescopes, which were instruments of very questionable truth value, as they were 90% artefacts and noise, and 10% signal. Compare it to you visiting the doctor to get an echo scan; the doctor points at some random blobs on a screen filled with noise, and tells you ""this shows you have disease X"". *Sure*, you can believe them on their pretty blue eyes, but do you *really* see what they see? So too, when Galileo pointed his shitty telescope towards Jupiter and then said to other people ""Look! those are moons!"", other people *literally* didn't understand what they were supposed to see. It was just noise to them, because they weren't proficient in telescope observations, philosophically they didn't really believe that optics gives you a 'real' image of the world (it's an artificial observation!), and they had little reason to believe Galileo (nor should they have; Galileo was wrong about pretty much everything he ever said)"	human
822	"Mostly in that the evidence is a little scarce. There are period depictions, such as some woodcuts by Albrecht Dürer, which show guys with halberds and zweihanders fighting at the forefront of pike formations, but is that what's really going on, or is it just compressed for artistic reasons? There are period descriptions of pike formations that put the swordsmen closer to the rear. Exactly what was their role on the battlefield, and how did they fulfill that role? Were they really employed to break up pike blocks, or were they more for handling close-quarters combat or for preventing their own pike block from being disrupted? Were they shock troops? Were they more like ""bodyguard"" troops for the commanders? If they were breaking up opposing pike blocks, how did they do this? Did they cut off the pike heads with their blades? Did they push the pikes out of the way and attack the pikemen directly? Did they do something else? Was their role like that of the Spanish *Rodelleros* or the Italian sword-and-buckler men? "	human

But he also noted using tin is not entirely practical. 	human
828	"A woman who was a nanny would continue in that line of work, rather than being given duties in the kitchen or something after the child was grown.  Upper- and upper-middle-class infants were typically put in the care of a nursemaid, a position which became known as a ""nanny"" by the end of the century. (Isabella Beeton estimated that a family with at least £300 a year could and should hire one, along with a maid-of-all-work; it's only above that level that cooks, housemaids, etc. were suggested. That should tell you how difficult and time-consuming taking care of an infant is even outside of diapering!) The most affluent establishments would have an ""upper nursemaid"" or ""head nurse"" in charge of the entire nursery, with lower nursemaids under her direction. If a wet nurse was being used, as she very well may have been throughout most of the nineteenth century, she would be below this upper nursemaid in rank, although the wet nurse sort of existed outside the nursery structure - her job was to provide a commodity, milk, rather than to look after the child itself, unless said child was being placed in the nurse's home.   Nursemaids would feed babies, wash them, dress them, take care of their clothes and toys, take them for walks, teach them good habits, and report on their condition and progress to their parents. When there were lower nursemaids, they would do a lot of messy work around the nursery - scrubbing the floors, bringing up and taking away meals, lighting fires, making the beds - possibly in conjunction with a ""nursery girl"" who would do the worst of it. The upper nursemaid, or the only nursemaid in a smaller household, would have to know what to do for teething, colic, croup, and other childhood ailments. She would also have to be someone with good references as to her character; in the best cases, she would be clean, sober, and careful, but some certainly were abusive. The future Viceroy of India, once grown, would describe his and his siblings' nanny as having kept them in such a state of terror that they were too frightened to tell their parents of the beatings and painful punishments she meted out.  Some nursemaids stayed with a family through successive generations of children - possibly going to another branch of the family while the ones they raised grew to maturity? - but most would leave the household once their charges were in the care of a tutor or governess and find employment elsewhere, either by answering an advertisement in the newspaper, signing up with an agency, or just going through word of mouth.

831	"Hi! As this question pertains to basic, underlying facts of the Holocaust, I hope you can appreciate that it can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we want people to get the answers they are looking for, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of response. As such, this message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as Holocaust Denial, and provide a short list of introductory reading. There is always more than can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you.  ##What Was the Holocaust?  The Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.  ##But This Guy Says Otherwise!  Unfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*  It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.  ##So What Are the Basics?  Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership. First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.  The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too.   By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.  Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.  ##The Camps  There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.  Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.  The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.  Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was a vast complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.  ##How Do We Know?  Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll end this with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.  ##Further Reading  * ""[Third Reich Trilogy](https://books.google.com/books?id=HZmXOPGTGjIC)"" by Richard Evans * ""[Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7FiPwAACAAJ)"" by Ian Kershaw * ""[Auschwitz: A New History](https://books.google.com/books?id=Wh9QVS3A5QIC)"" by Laurence Rees * ""[Ordinary Men](https://books.google.com/books?id=HFB-dkuZzSwC)"" by Christopher Browning * ""[Denying the Holocaust](https://books.google.com/books?id=_yLm_cHp_REC)"" by Deborah E.

833	They're not especially similar. The Homestead Act of 1962 opened up millions of acres of publicly-held land for private settlement, entirely at the discretion of the settles (provided they complied with the regulations on acreage and so forth). The precise terms of Ti. Gracchus' *lex agraria* are not certain, but it's quite clear from our texts and from the *lex agraria* of 111 that it broke up holdings of the *ager publicus* in excess of 500 *iugera* and distributed the *ager publicus* to rural Roman citizens (apparently at the expense of the allies, though our sources are not the clearest on this point). Roman citizens--and the allies--could already occupy the *ager publicus*, however, meaning that the Gracchan land commission was not organizing the mass settlement of the *ager publicus*. Instead, the *lex agraria* established a board of three commissioners that would review holdings of the *ager publicus* to determine what holdings were above the 500 *iugera* limit imposed by a previous law and to survey the *ager publicus* more efficiently to distribute what was remaining to unlanded rural citizens. The Gracchan land bill neither took away private land nor did it massively populate unsettled land. Rather, it established clearer small landholdings and privatized (or at least established security on) the *ager publicus*, which legally could be occupied by anybody who paid the necessary tithe in kind to the state. In this it doesn't resemble the Homestead Act of 1862 very much at all, which established the mass settlement of previously uninhabited (at least by white settlers) land, exclusively for private use from the start. Moreover, the scale of Ti. *lex agraria* is an order of magnitude smaller. The *ager publicus* offered substantial land for small holdings (ten *iugera*? Thirty *iugera*? It's not clear how large the usual distribution was) but was hardly on the scale of the American frontier in 1862. The Gracchan agrarian bill specifically excluded the *ager Campanus*, the enormous expanse of highly fertile land around Capua, and the *ager publicus* distributed likely consisted only of fairly (disappointingly, even) small areas of land immediately around a couple of cities in southern Campania and possibly some land in Apulia and Lucania (following Roselarr). 	human

836	First, I will cop to interpreting the question in an ethnocentric way. My experience here is that people asking about a date range with no geographic region attached are asking about Europe, or America, or the west in general, and so I typically answer accordingly even if they haven't made it absolutely clear through the context of the question.  Secondly, this is not an answer about white people/people of European descent: this is an answer about the western clothing tradition. While most of the people engaging in it were white, and most of the people not engaging in it were not white, there were *many* people of color in Europe and the Americas who dressed this way, whether because they were forced to abandon their traditional clothing by enslavers or because they chose to assimilate, particularly in the 19th century.

838	"I've heard that, too, although I heard it mostly coming from English Civil War reenactor circles. I've also seen reenactors *raise* their pikes before the two formations collide. I've no idea if it was *actually* a thing in-period, but I highly doubt it. Doing so would sacrifice the main advantage of a pike, that being its reach.   There are numerous references in-period to a ""push of pike"" where two opposing pike blocks would--literally--push forward into each other. It seems that during this rugby scrum is when most of the shooting with arquebuses happened, and that the pikes could get interfingered and tangled up like a devilish game of pick-up-sticks. There's a description of the Battle of Langside (1568 between the armies of Mary Queen of Scots and James Stewart, Earl of Moray) that both side's infantry engaged in a push of pike. During the engagement, men behind the front ranks would shoot pistols into the opposing mass of bodies, then throw their empty pistols, and that the thrown pistols would lay on the horizontal tangled mass of pikes instead of falling to the ground. Hyperbole, sure, but impossible if the pike blocks weren't engaging with their pikes directed horizontally directly toward the enemy.  It seems the Rodeleros, sword-and-buckler and perhaps the Dopelsölnders (of zweihander and other variety) were instrumental in breaking the stalemate of the push of pike.   Pike heads aren't lightsabers. You don't die just because one touched you. Unlike a smaller spear, it's kind of hard to thrust with a pike, but you can walk forward with them quite effectively and put a lot of weight behind it (we know that sometimes pikemen would cut down their pikes to make them shorter which gave an advantage in close-quarters fighting, but was said to be disadvantageous when facing other, longer, pikes). We also know that many front-like pikemen wore armor consisting of at least a breastplate. Perhaps pushing two pike columns into each other wasn't instantly lethal to the front ranks (otherwise, why would they put their captains in the front ranks like we know they did?).   At the Battle of Ceresole (1544 between France and an alliance of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain), the French army tried and experiment. Usually, the arquebusiers flanked a central column of pikes, but the French commander put a line of arquebusiers in the second rank immediately behind a font rank of pikemen with orders to fire only once the two columns met and the press of pikes began, thus shooting directly into the front ranks of the Spanish and Imperial troops and killing their captains. Unfortunately (?) the French found that their opponents had the same idea, putting a line of pistoleers in their second rank with the same intention. Both sides fired and both front ranks fell. This was reported as distressing and unusual.   Later in the same battle, a push of pikes occured between a Swiss contingent on the French side and the landsknechts on the Imperial side. The press was a stalemate until French heavy cavalry hit the landsknechts flank, breaking them. An Imperial cavalry unit then threatened the Swiss pike block, but were seen off by the wall of Swiss pikes."	human

843	"The simple answer is that the ""if"" you pose is wrong. Pre-modern Japan had an adequate iron supply. In the early 20th century, Japanese domestic iron ore production was about 135,000 tons per year, which, while small compared to the 600,000 tons of ore imported in 1918, was much larger than the amount used by the traditional iron industry, which was producing about 10-15,000 tons of iron and steel per year at the end of the Edo Period (so perhaps 30,000 tons of ore per year).  The Edo Period limit on iron production wasn't the availability of ore, but labour costs and fuel (charcoal). The threat of deforestation - a significant part of which was due to the iron industry - led to environmental protection laws by the Tokugawa Shogunate.  How many soldiers can you equip with armour with 1,000 tons? Assuming a lot of waste in manufacturing, with much of the iron lost as forge scale, 50kg would provide sufficient iron/steel for the armour and weapons of a fully-armoured soldier. So if 1,000 tons per year went into the arms industry, that would be 20,000 fully-armoured soldiers newly equipped per year.  The largest armies of the time were about 150,000 men, and the largest battles had about 200-300,000 men, so it would have taken a few years to make enough armour for them all (not that all of them were fully armoured), but was certainly possible.  Also note that a lot of Japanese armour was rawhide lamellar armour, or a mix of rawhide and iron lamellae, so some of what looks like iron armour is not."	human
844	"You might be interested in some of the comments [In this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7pqspn/how_did_latemedieval_and_earlymodern_pike_units/) which briefly touch on the role of two-handed greatswords in pike combat. In short they're usually described played the same role as the other ""short weapons"", being placed somewhere in the middle of a pike square to be used in a close quarters and to defend the ensigns in case the formation in case the pike square ever lost cohesion and the battle devolved into ""pell mell"". They could also be used outside the pike square by certain officers like sergents for self defense. Or troops armed with short weapons could be mixed in with light skirmishers to back them up in a skirmish or to fight on rough terrain or assault trenches.  As for their use against armor, no swords wouldn't be able to actually cut through plate armor unless it was an extremely low quality. But despite the Italian wars possibly seeing the use of plate armor reach its peak many military writers still recommend two-handed weapons which can give powerful downward blows for use in armored melees. In particular there seems to have been some debate between shorter, stouter, halberds with wide, heavy, chopping blades which were considered better in a pell mell and long, lightweight, thrust-centric halberds which were considered better in a dual or a skirmish.  Two-handed swords were known for being able to decapitate and inflict other terrible wounds on unarmored targets, but against a man in armor a greatsword could still have enough force to disorient, concuss, or knock him to the ground with powerful blows."	human

846	"The modern graph dates to the late 18th century.^1 William Playfair was a notable pioneer, and explicitly discussed the merits of graphs.^2 A sampling of Playfair's graphs can be seen at https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/10/these-250-year-old-charts-and-graphs-were-the-very-first-infographics/  Before Playfair, tabular presentation of data was usual. Tabular presentation was still common afterwards, and is still common today, since it provides precision, while the graph provides easy visual comparison.  Playfair wasn't the first modern graph-maker. Johann Lambert, a Swiss-German scientist, was already using graphs in his published work in 1765,^1,3 and can be considered the inventor of the modern graphical presentation of experimental data in science.  Tufte^3 gives an overview of early graphs (including some nice examples of Lambert's work) and other data visualisations, including a 10th or 11th century example.^4  1. L. Tilling, ""Early experimental graphs"", *British Journal for the History of Science* 8, 193-213 (1975).  2. W. Playfair, *The Commercial and Political Atlas*, 1786.  3. E. R.

847	"Speaking more on the point about Bach. I think what we have to think about is how genre impacts this notion of ""cohesiveness"" in a work. There are works composed to be heard in a single sitting, most notably dramatic works such as operas or (closer to Bach's style) Oratorios or Cantatas. But with instrumental pieces, especially pieces for solo instruments, it's much harder to say what grouping them together does, as there certainly wasn't a robust network of ""recital performances"" the way you have today. So even if you owned a book of piano sonatas, or preludes and fugues, or a keyboard suite, you aren't likely going to be *performing* them in public for any reason. You are just playing them for your own amusement.   So I think we have to keep in mind that even if a composer composed a cycle of works such as a set of cello pieces, they have zero control (and they know it) over the order in which the pieces will be consumed or presented.

849	"I'm always skeptical of people saying ""finally a question I can answer"", but this is finally a question I can answer with my Eastern European Studies degree.  In a communist state like the USSR, enterprises were generally state-owned. This was after all one of the fundamental principles of communist economics: property and capital was not to be owned by individuals (capitalists - traditionally not a term of ideology, but of social class), but rather by all people manifested in the state. This was not absolute and also differed between communist countries, so in some places smaller firms or argicultural enterprises could actually be private-owned, or collectively owned, but those were more exceptions than the rule: in general, enterprises were part of the state.  It is also worth noting that, despite being state-owned, these enterprises were not the same as government institutions: in many ways they functioned as companies as was known outside of the Eastern Bloc, in terms of governance and structure. The main difference was that there was no individual ""owner"", but that the owner was a ministry or other government agency. This system sounded nice on paper but was generally completely ineffective in practice. Don't forget that Tetris wasn't an invention by ELORG, they just happened to own the license.  The collapse of the USSR coincided with the fall of communism. This means that the USSR - now succeeded by independent republics including Russia - transitioned to a market economy akin to most of the rest of the world. One of the most fundamental changes in the economic system is the transfer of ownership from the state to private hands: privatization (this takes place on a smaller scale in non-communist countries as well).  Now think about how to transfer _virtually every single company in Russia_, including shops, restaurants, factories, mines, airlines, from the state to private individuals: how do you even start? Who can get ownership? It's a massive operation. Opening an auction per company for everyone in the country to bid on (like we do nowadays if a single company is privatized) would be completely impossible given the large number of firms we're talking about.  I won't bore you with how it was actually done, but the bottom line is that it was chaotic and intransparent, especially in former Soviet republics like Russia. Insiders of companies, such as managers, often had priority in bidding for the companies - either formally, or informally through their networks. Oftentimes, they could purchase shares of the company for cheap and would make great money out of their assets. This is where the Russian oligarchs come from.   Of course oligarchs emerge from huge corporations in for example the gas and oil sectors. But the same applied to smaller firms such as ELORG. Now, I don't know anything about ELORG itself except for the documentary, but I can imagine Belikov having purchased shares of ELORG as a director, then also becoming the owner. As you can see form the docu, he also made alot of money from what once used to be state property (i.e. the Tetris license). The funny thing is that it Pajitov wasn't even an ELORG employee: ELORG just happened to be the state publisher and for that reason Belikov (rightfully, one must say) appropriated the rights of Tetris from Pajitov and the science lab to ELORG. Little did he know that five years later he would become personal owner and profiteer of that move.  To address your question directly: The Russian government didn't keep the Tetris licenses because it was part of the general transition to a market economy to dispose of state-owned firms and transfer them to private hands.  TL;DR: When the USSR/Russia turned into a market economy, firms like ELORG were privatized. Belikov became the new owner, probably by using his inside position (legally or illicitly), and made alot of money from Tetris. Belikov is a mini-oligarch."	human
850	"Kerr was on the mark for the some of the property stolen from Jews murdered in the camps and *Einsatzgruppen*. There was a deliberate policy to ease the burdens of the war through stolen Jewish property and a number of municipal authorities appealed to the central state for such Jewish plunder. Generally, there were three methods to siphon this plunder into the German civilian economy. Some of it was given away or sold at bargain basement prices by various governmental authorities. The escalating RAF bombing campaign arguably added an impetus to the clearing out of the Reich's remaining Jews in places such as Hamburg as the regional *Gauleiter*s anticipated using Jewish property to allieviate discontent. The  *Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt* (Nationals Socialist Welfare Society/NSV) was one of the main distributors for this property, but local charities also received these goods as well (and side note, do not go to the English-wiki page for the NSV, its chief editor is one of the Nazis=socialist types and a lot of their citations do not match the original source material. It is one of those examples of the flaws of wikipedia). The second method these goods ended up in civilian hands was through auctions, sometimes held via the NSV or others through municipal authorities or private businesses. These items tended to be domestic in nature ranging from furniture, tea towels, cookware, to actual apartments and were from the domiciles of evacuated or murdered Jews. Prices were often quite low given both the quality of the merchandise and the shortages within the civilian economy. The final method was direct one to one distribution from someone directly involved in the killing process to their social circle back in the Reich. More than a few SS and Wehrmacht men on the Eastern front helped themselves to the mounds of Jewish property collected during the killing effort. If you read between the lines of Himmler's famous Posen speech, he warns that no true SS man would dare enrich himself doing his duty and warned that anyone caught enriching himself ""is a dead man.""   Of course, there is *massive* evidence that members of the SS did enrich themselves and their families through unauthorized theft of Jewish property. The SS took custodianship of valuable property and other sundry items of their victims. But the SS was not alone in this regard. In typical Nazi fashion, there were overlapping and competing agencies for the administration of occupied territories. The German occupation also used a number of local, non-German intermediaries to facilitate shipping property back to the Reich. The so-called *Möbel-Aktion* (Furniture Action) in the Low Countries and France began in 1942 under the authority of Alfred Rosenberg's *Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg* (Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce/ERR) to clear out Jewish furniture in Western Europe. Local non-German furniture wholesalers and other dealers assisted this operation and received both money and the less valuable furnishing for their own businesses.    Both the organized and wildcat theft of Jewish property is a tale that had not only multiple villains, but also a great many accomplices and beneficiaries.   For more reading on this, Martin Dean's *Robbing the Jews* is one of the recent monographs on this topic and he has poured over a number of ledgers and spreadsheets that exposes the scale of this aspect of the Holocaust.  The US Holocaust Museums has also put up a [pdf](https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Publication_OP_2003-01.pdf) of a symposium on confiscated Jewish property that also covers this aspect of Nazi criminality.

855	"**What was the British public's reaction to a German who didn't speak English coming over to rule in 1714?** Thackeray, despite being a 19th century author, uncritically passes on the general view of the time: ""His heart was in Hanover... we took him because we wanted him, because he served our turn; we laughed at his uncouth German ways, and sneered at him. He took our loyalty for what it was worth; laid hands on what money he could; kept us assuredly from Popery... Cynical and selfish, as he was, he was better than a king out of St. Germains with the French king's orders in his pocket, and a swarm of Jesuits in his train.""  George was widely ridiculed and criticized. His subjects criticized him for nearly everything. They criticized his two mistresses for not being pretty enough. They criticized him simply for being German. They criticized him for never learning to speak English, even though we know he read, wrote, and spoke it perfectly by the latter half of his reign. His treatment of his wife was considered a scandal (and, to be fair, was genuinely bad). He was considered wooden and unpersonable, which sometimes became accusations of stupidity.  However, despite this, George I had wide support as monarch, even from the start. While most of the English didn't like him personally, they universally acknowledged his Protestantism and respect for constitutional government. He also managed to keep things relatively stable. This was important in a country that had just undergone half a century of civil wars and coups over who got to be monarch. He was considered good for England, even if not personally popular, and he ruled a country that was secure, stable, prosperous, and free.  **Were they used to foreign rulers by that point?** England had been ruled by Scottish Stuarts since 1603, with a brief interruption of William and Mary (a Dutch Prince and his Stuart wife). The Stuarts also married other royals, meaning Charles I, Charles II, and James II all had foreign mothers (James I's parents were both Scottish, and Queen Anne's parents were both English). But the dynasty was largely English in character, spending most of its time in London. Additionally, Scotland and England were culturally similar by this point, a process accelerated by the personal union. For example, the Scottish and English elite languages were somewhat mutually intelligible.  So while England was, in some sense, used to foreign royals and rulers who might not be perfectly English, they were not used to the King himself being radically non-English. There was the example of William of Oranje, but he spoke English, had close ties to England, and had married an Englishwoman. George I, in contrast, was widely seen as a completely alien person. This was much commented on at the time, as seen above.  However, George I had one great advantage: he was Protestant. In fact, he was chosen because he was the closest relative to the King who was Protestant. This was seen as an even more important qualification than being English. Parliament passed over about fifty Catholics, some of whom were English, to give him the throne. He was Lutheran, yes, and the Anglican Church was more Reformed, but such disputes were less important than the Catholic-Protestant distinction.  **Did this hamper George I's ability to rule in any way?** George was not entirely German himself. He had a claim to the crown through his grandmother, Elizabeth of Bohemia, who was English. (But married the Winter King, and thus gained 'of Bohemia'.) Also, it's clear by about 1720 George could speak English and not entirely clear that he couldn't beforehand. He was also fluent in French and Latin, both of which would have been common at court. So it's unlikely he had real trouble communicating with his ministers  This was an age before mass politics and he would not have often been expected to appear in public. George I was particularly loathe to do so and usually declined to give any speeches, even to Parliament. This was notably in character with George I in general. George I hated being in public or watched, even in private non-formal settings. He didn't even like people looking at his carriage as it traveled.  George was not an ineffective monarch. However, England was already largely a constitutional monarchy and George I accelerated the process. George I and his ministers basically created the political regime that lasted in Britain for at least a century, and arguably continues to this day. His embracing of constitutional monarchy and reorganizing government to put more power in ministerial hands is sometimes seen as personal or political weakness (or apathy). Yet it's apparent from the records of the time these powerful ministers, while pursuing their own agendas, understood themselves to serve at the King's pleasure. George I took an interest in policy and influenced it. It's also apparent George was purposefully empowering these ministers rather than being forced to against his will.  It is possible George I was 'seeing the writing on the wall' and deciding to go with the flow rather than fight the current. That's another question. Certainly George I could have, like his predecessor Queen Anne, tried to take a more active role in affairs. He chose not to, and largely achieved his policy objectives without exerting such direct power."	human

857	"This is an excellent reply, and this part in particular should be re-emphasized:  &gt; Wool isn’t “self cleaning” per se but is much more dirt resistant than many fibers we wear today, including modern wools both very fine/thin and lower quality/rough. One interesting quality of wool is that it can be aired out, not something that would work with those polyester leggings you’ve got there. So the everyman suit, ladies “walking” skirt suits, outerwear, and even athletic clothing of the day was all made of wool, and could be aired at the end of the day.  Wool resists body odors effectively, and this is noticeably different from plant fibers like cotton and linen, and especially modern fibers like polyester.  I have never washed any of the wool outer garments I currently wear to reenactment events. I air them out when I get home, use a horsehair brush to knock off any mud (following directions from 19th century handbooks for butlers!), and find that they smell pleasantly of wood smoke when I next wear them. In contrast, my linen underthings smell just as you would expect, and need regular laundering.  When you look at early medieval textiles (my expertise is 6th century England, in particular), you find that the fibers of woolen garments are never ""fulled."" Fulling is what happens when you roughly wash wool, causing it to shrink a bit and become a little bit more like felt. This wasn't done to early medieval woolen fabrics--and this means that, if they were washed, they were washed gently and infrequently. Given my personal experience wearing these garments for days at reenactment events, that doesn't surprise me."	human

859	"It would not be accurate to say he ""added it"", because as was Mary Beard basic point there is no ancient tradition of a well described and prescriptive triumphal procession. Instead authors primarily focus on either remarkable moments in specific triumphs (such as Pompey's troublesome elephants) or mention it in a vague, offhand sense. So saying he added this is a bit like saying that Pliny added the detail of generals painting their face.  That said, Tertullian Apology 33 is the earliest attestation of it (the other ancient attestation is Jerome, who was probably cribbing from Tertullian) which is a bit late in a significant way that becomes clear in the passage itself:  &gt;Negat illum imperatorem qui deum dicit; nisi homo sit, non est imperator. [4] Hominem se esse etiam triumphans in illo sublimissimo curru admonetur; suggeritur enim ei a tergo: ""Respice post te! Hominem te memento!"" Et utique hoc magis gaudet tanta se gloria coruscare, ut illi admonitio condicionis suae sit necessaria. Minor erat, si tunc deus diceretur, quia non vere diceretur. Maior est qui revocatur, ne se deum existimet.  Quick and (very) dirty translation:  &gt;The one who calls [the emperor] a god denies him to be emperor; for unless he is a person, he cannot be emperor. The one triumphing in his sublime chariot is reminded that he is a man, for it is suggested to him from behind ""Look behind you! Remember you are a man!"" And by all means he greatly delights to furnish himself with such glory, such that the reminder of his situation would be neccesary. It would be demeaning, if he were called a god at that time, because it would not be true. Greater is the one addressed to not call himself a god.  The context is an extended passage in which Tertullian defends Christians from the charge of subversiveness due to their lack of participation in the imperial cult. So even if we are to take his information as correct (which it may or may not be, he seems to *think* it was but he did not actually live in Rome and is a rather motivated source in general), right out the gate it is only applicable to triumphs during the principate, not the Republic, when the Triumph was *actually* for victorious generals.

862	&gt; This was an age before mass politics  That's not strictly true. The early 18th century had a pretty vibrant political culture, which was not restricted to the inner circles of the royal court. The 'middling sort' - professionals, merchants and the like - were actively engaged in things like coffee-house discussion (most coffee houses had political affiliations), and reading periodicals such as *The Spectator*. London is particularly interesting, because the electoral system in the borough of Westminster (which covered the western half of the city) was 'scot and lot' - a property tax which most male householders paid. The sheer size of the electorate in Westminster meant that it was rarely under the control of a patron, and that an unusually high number of residents were active voters.  A wider swathe of society, including the working people and poor, could and did participate in political action on the streets  - for example, the Sacheverell Riots in London, in 1710. If you lived in an urban area, particularly in London, you had multiple opportunities to engage in political discourse, even if you weren't an enfranchised voter.  Anyway, with specific reference to George I... While he was largely welcomed in the first instance, as a means of continuing Protestant hegemony, there was a Jacobite uprising against his accession in 1715. It was crushed, of course, but attracted support from a considerable number of disgruntled Tories, who considered James (the son of the exiled James II and Mary of Modena) to be the true heir to the throne. It's also worth bearing in  mind that, as he worked with the Whigs under Walpole, Stanhope and Townshend to consolidate his accession, he inevitably became associated with the unpopularity and of the Whig ministry, which was became a byword for corruption (especially under Walpole after 1722) despite its astonishing longevity. The king's personal popularity suffered enormously in the aftermath of the South Sea Bubble scandal (1721), as he was perceived to have supported the South Sea scheme.	human

866	Boxing does become incredibly popular as a 'gentleman's sport' from the late 18th century, reaching its fashionable peak between c.1810-30. That said, it was still largely regarded as a spectator sport, with working class men doing most of the actual fighting. Pierce Egan, an Irish sportswriter living in London, wrote a popular series of articles which were printed in several volumes between 1813 and 1829 as *Boxiana: or, the science of pugilism ancient and modern*, which consolidated the status of boxing as a fashionable sport. You can see a representation of an 1820s boxing match [here](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/tom-jerry-and-logic-backing-tommy-the-sweep-at-the-royal-news-photo/113632041#tom-jerry-and-logic-backing-tommy-the-sweep-at-the-royal-cockpit-the-picture-id113632041), taken from Egan's other major publication, *Life in London*.  That said, I haven't come across any accounts of elite men settling their personal disputes by way of a boxing bout. It may well have been done among boys - William Thackeray, writing in the 1840s but looking back to the 1800s-1810s, put a fistfight between gentleman schoolboys (Dobbin and George) into the plot of his novel *Vanity Fair*.	human
867	If the Duke was richer, more influential and more ostentatious than the king, why couldn't his wedding outshine the king's?  Kings can be quite, sober and reserved; they can hold religious beliefs that oppose unnecessary spectacles; they can be broke and not able to afford a lavish wedding; they can be unpoopular or politically weak and consequently the movers and shakers of society are busy washing their hair on the day of the wedding.  And Dukes can be the opposite of all of these things.  The bottom line is, there is no rule that says all royal weddings must be flashier and more showy than dukes' weddings. It depends on the circumstances: a weak king from a country that is broke could easily have a simple wedding, and a rich, powerful duke a spectacular wedding.	human
868	The essential nature of the economic programme is laid out in the *Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty*, which most notably set out a system of common ownership of property. Land was to be divided into nine grades depending on fertility, and then equally distributed such that each individual of 16 years of age or older, whether male or female, received the same proportion, and each individual under 15 half of that. All surplus food and money was nominally to be passed to an official in charge of a communal treasury and redistributed as needed. Said officials were supposed to be elected by the populace, and were also responsible for ensuring the exercise of religious practices, failure to do so being grounds for a communally-decided punishment.^1 This served as a stark contrast to the near-monopolisation of land by wealthy landowners who rented said land out for agriculture, and indeed this redistribution of land and resources (including to the elderly and disabled) was even noted as unusually philanthropic by Western observers in 1854.^2  The key element of the Taiping social agenda was the merger of military and civilian social structures, such that civil society was organised on military lines, with families organised into groups of powers of 5, with the smallest grouping with administrative functions appearing to be that of 25 families, for which would be provided a granary, a church and the requisite services, as well being the source and beneficiary of its own tradesmen, such as carpenters and smiths. An 'army' would ultimately consist of 13,156 families, each with a general commanding five colonels, each commanding five captains, each commanding five lieutenants, each commanding five sergeants, each commanding one corporal and four privates.^1 The military organisation was not in and of itself new – the old *de jure* militia system of *tuanlian* had also used fixed numbers like so – but did clash with the *de facto* system of *baojia*, which was more organically formed and based around local population sizes,^3 and of course the merger of civilian society and military organisation was immensely radical.  A temporary but nonetheless severe Taiping social policy was the segregation of male and female. Although women were given nominally equal status, for a while Taiping policy was that, since all men were brothers through God and all women were sisters, any sexual desire was inherently incestuous. Although the latter policy appears to have been unpopular enough to be dropped (and indeed the senior leadership freely flouted this policy to maintain personal harems anyway), the equal status was seized upon.^4 ^5 Indeed, a woman, Fu Shanxiang, became a senior bureaucrat under Yang Xiuqing,^6 whilst the British volunteer Augustus Lindley claimed that up to a quarter of the Taiping army was made up of women.^7  The other potentially unpopular policy was a ban on gambling, alcohol and opium on pain of death,^4 ^8 although this was similarly widely flouted. Opium smoking was no less uncommon among the Taiping than in Imperial-held areas,^9 and an Irish mercenary in Yang Xiuqin'g employ shortly before his execution in 1856 noted afterwards that he was billeted with a man with a sizeable stock of rice-wine.^4 Augustus Lindley was also displeased with the heavy drinking of the American officer Henry Burgevine, recently defected from the Ever-Victorious Army after its takeover by 'Chinese' Gordon.^7 The ban on alcohol was in fact so extreme that Hong Xiuquan's version of the Bible edited out any reference to righteous men consuming it.^4 The ban on alcohol wasn't just flouted by Westerners with the Taiping, however. The aforementioned Fu Shanxiang only narrowly avoided execution after the ban was re-iterated.^6  Sources and References:  * 1 *Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty*, incl. in Franz H.

871	By the 17th century, especially the 1640s when the film is set, the only remaining practicing Christians were likely to be die-hards. Much of the behavior shown among the converts in the film and novel — reluctance on pain of death to disrespect Christian images or to express verbal contempt for the Virgin Mary, placing urgent importance on baptism and confession, the convert Monica’s belief that Heaven will be superior to their current state because it removes them from the suffering of feudalism — is pretty orthodox for a faithful 17th century Catholic, even one born and raised in Europe. The priests are their means of accessing the sacraments (besides baptism, which iirc is handled by the religious community’s layperson leader, the jiisama) and engaging with what they see as their own salvation and that of their children in an isolated and politically oppressive context that restricts their access to Christian images as well as prayer. Furthermore, they’re Catholic in the first place — worship using images and songs isn’t unique to Japanese Catholics but in the context of the film these traditional elements are guarded so fervently and jealously because they’re left over from an earlier era of comparative religious toleration.   However, not all Japanese people in this era who had formally received Christianity via baptism cleaved to it to that degree — in addition to those who renounced Christianity under duress there were others who left off Christianity willingly, either for political expedience after the ebb of direct Catholic influence in Japan or out of general waning interest. (The film’s version of Inoue is in one of those latter categories.) After severing contact altogether with external European Catholic influence, remaining Japanese Christians (“hidden Christians”) ultimately developed their own customs and worship styles independent of Roman Catholicism and independent of the services of European-style priests. I’m on mobile right now so I can’t do a preliminary roundup of sources but I’d love to give any information that might help contextualize why the film’s Japanese Christians appear so fervent and why their reliance on the two European Jesuits in their midst is so intense.	human
872	"&gt; Should be noted that 50kg is VERY heavy for armour and weapons.  Yes. A full Japanese armour is typically 15-25kg, not all, but mostly, the weight or the iron/steel for a late iron/steel armour. Add perhaps about 3kg for the iron/steel portion of the weapons.  But ""assuming a lot of waste in manufacturing, with much of the iron lost as forge scale,"" starting with 50kg of iron/steel, you end up with less than 50kg of armour and weapons.  Over half of the initial steel - even 3/4 of it - can be lost when forging a sword (see, e.g., L. Kapp et al., *The Craft of the Japanese Sword*, Kodansha, 1987). I don't have data for wastage when making armour; I expect it to be smaller."	human

875	Anecdotal, but as a schoolboy I attended a seminar where groups of children spent a day with different holocaust survivors. The gentleman I was with was assigned to Kanada, and his recollection was that it was a safer place removed from the rest of the camp activities, and those assigned there had a better chance of survival. After the war he returned to Poland, found he was the last survivor of his family, and that his family property was in the possession of others who refused to return it. He ended up emigrating to Canada, which he said he knew nothing about prior to moving there except that it must be a good place if the prisoners named the safest spot in the camp after it. So there must have been some association of “Kanada” with “Canada”, at least in this one particular survivor’s mind.   Completely anecdotal, and I hope the gentleman I spent a day with had his story recorded in a more official way for history’s sake. I am extremely grateful to this day for his taking time to tell his story to a group of Canadian school children years ago. 	human

878	"The history of Sub-Saharan Africa is certainly one neglected field. There's a few reasons for this. Above all, African history is plagued by the question of sources. Although some people in Sub-Saharan Africa, say those on the Swahili coast and what is now Mali, have old written records, many others do not. As such, historians are forced to rely on anthropological, linguistic, and biological (including genetic) evidence, as well as sources like art. Colonial records are used, but there are questions of reliability. The British, French, Germans, Belgians, etc. did not really care a ton about documenting African histories and they arrived on the continent with a number of preconceptions that lead them in directions that are difficult to get past (for example, the ""tribe"" as a discrete group, the idea that Africa has not changed and was still ""prehistoric"" when they arrived, etc.   Because the whole field is so theoretically and methodologically difficult, texts on Sub-Saharan Africa can be *really* difficult to read. This prevents the history of Africa from drifting into the public mind, by and large.  Besides that, another case is Central Asian history (our famous ""-stans""). This is more often a linguistic issue, as there is a ton of literature on that region in Russian, but little of it gets translated to English. Moreover, Anglophone historians don't tend to research it nearly as much (although some institutions like Indiana University produce a voluminous amount of knowledge in the region).   Surely there are others, but these are the first two regions that come to mind for me."	human

881	"It depends what you mean by ""antipathy"". And ""most people"".  I first want to link to and quote from a very recent answer I wrote:  [We're accustomed to changing our clothes every day. Sometimes more than once a day. How often did people change and wash their clothes in the 1700s and 1800s?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7ushcx/were_accustomed_to_changing_our_clothes_every_day/dtneepe/)  &gt;In the early modern period, there's evidence that people began bathing less specifically because they could have more changes of linen, which took care of the issue. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the ideal was to change at least every day, perhaps more often if one had gotten sweaty doing something physical or if the day were hot - having clean clothes made you more comfortable, obviously, and having crisp, fresh linen around the neckline of your clothes or peeking out from your sleeves was a symbol of both your social status and your moral standing - fiction and non-fiction of the 18th century takes note of the state of individuals' linen, drawing conclusions from the contradiction between someone's greasy, dirty shirt and other fine things they might have. Dirty linen was also thought to cause or attract illness by trapping impurities and ""poisons"" next to the skin.  By the end of the eighteenth century, the pendulum was swinging back again and many doctors were recommending that people not just visit mineral springs to take the waters (which had meant drinking as often as actually jumping in), but that they take regular baths at home; individuals were also judging each other and other cultures based on their attitudes towards bathing as cleaning with water became an important aspect of gentility, in the same way that visibly clean body linen had previously been. It took longer to catch on in the nascent United States, where it had several serious obstacles: the belief that the countryside (which the US largely was at this point) was already naturally healthy, making bathing unnecessary; the difficulty in heating enough water to fill a tub; the old-fashioned view among the Protestant middle class of bathing as a sensuous, sinful indulgence; and the desire to be different from [insert stereotype here] Europe. But it was generally accepted that infants and children needed regular bathing, and urban elites were installing newfangled showers and bathtubs in their homes - even public baths were making a reappearance. For more on this transition, I would suggest *Foul Bodies: Cleanliness in Early America*, by Kathleen M. Brown.  By the Victorian era, the middle classes were champions of the concept of sanitation in all aspects of life, from personal hygiene to cleaning the streets - many public voices called for people to take baths. Bathing could be problematic for many, if they didn't have the ability to regularly heat up a tub full of water or the money to visit a public bathhouse, but there was no widespread antipathy toward the idea of it. Without deodorant, those doing physical labor would have body odor, yes, but it's not as though people were generally unwashed, or didn't have any standard of cleanliness.  To soapbox a little, there's something of a tendency to revel in the supposed filth of the past, whether it's medieval peasants covered in mud, seventeenth century intellectuals eschewing immersion in water, or ragged Victorians. We haven't arrived at modern, particularly American standards of cleanliness through objectively determining them to be the best: there is an ideology beyond what's necessary to be clean. We have constructed our own conception of how personal hygiene relates to personal morality - what types of cleanliness relate to being a worthy person, and what types of uncleanliness are typical of the immoral."	human

890	I mean, I said in my initial answer:  &gt;After Alfred's decisive victory at Eddington, Guđrum, and by extension his army, converts to Christianity. Although this was most likely at spear-point, there is an implication, at least by Asser, that Guđrum accepts so readily because the completeness of the Christian victory tells him that their cause is more just and their god more powerful, and it is therefore in his best interests to convert.  Other than that, Bluetooth converts Denmark to Christianity (with the rest of Scandinavia following) because of the real and tangible benefits that I discussed in my linked response. Christianity brings with it the bureaucracy of the Catholic Church. This provides a prefabricated system of governmental control with pre-determined hierarchies, laws and systems of reporting which can be readily expanded throughout a king's territory to increase his control of land and further the legitimacy of his rule.	human

During the late 15th and early 16th century the tactics being copied from the Swiss and Landsknechts tended to involve forming pikemen into massive squares or columns sometimes 60-80 ranks deep. These great squares absolutely did seek to come into contact with the enemy infantry, even other pike squares and would often continue fighting at a ""push of pike"" for long periods of time with their flanks and rear protected by the shear depth of the formation and sometimes even withdrawing in good order.   By the end of the 16th century and throughout the 1700s however, pike squares started to become much smaller and thinner and firearms started to really take over as the primary killing weapon. Contemporaries noted that it became increasingly rare for pikemen to actually meet each other in melee and by the 1600s they were wearing less and less armor. While the ""push of pike"" didn't disappear completely, it started to act more like an 18th century bayonet charge in that either the attackers or defenders would often rout before or very shortly after making contact, and they especially didn't remain in melee long enough for it to devolve into a disorganized ""pell mell"" where short weapons like halberds and battle axes might be more effective than a pike.   From Robert Barret writing in 1598:  &gt;And againe it is rarely seene in our dayes, that men come often to hand-blowes, as in old time they did: For now in this age, the shot so employeth and busieth the field (being well backed with a resolute stand of pikes) that the most valiantest and skilfullest therein do commonly import the victorie, or the best, at the least wise, before men come to many hand-blowes.  From Benardino de Mendoza, writing in 1594:  &gt;The reason why men of olde time made so great accompt of the winde and sunne, was for that their battailes endured longe, and stoode vpon the strenght of their armes, but at this day, of verie short durance, thorough the violence and dexteritie of the cauallerie, vivacitie of the harquebuserie, and helped with the furie of the artillerie.  &gt;. . .   &gt;Among other in my iudgment, is the furie of the powder to be considered to be so great at this day, helped with the instrumēts of artillerie, muskets &amp; harquebuses, as not only it cōmeth to breake, as in times past did, throwing weapons, fallanges and legions, before comming to handstrokes, but disordereth and openeth squadrons &amp; battallons, defeating them, and so the greatest parte of victories which is gayned at this time, is by hauing obteyned them with artillerie or readines of harquebuserie by their liuelie voleyes, disorde∣ringe the squadrons of the enimie in such manner as they put them in rowte, and defeating them, without euer see∣ing or afronting them, except seldome-times the squadrons of pikes.

900	"I'm a bit confused by your question. What rules/laws are you talking about and by what time period? On the eve of the American Revolution, 1775, church attendance and membership was at an all-time low across the American colonies. In the few places where puritan laws existed that mandated church attendance, most from the 17th century, were no longer enforced or even existed.  Many historians have known and acknowledged that while most American professed to being religious, around 15% actually belonged to a church in 1775 and at most, 20% of Americans attended at least one church service annually.(1) This was significantly higher in parts of the south, such as South Carolina, which is estimated to have had around 30% church membership rates by 1775, the highest in all the colonies.   &gt; Did they have to go to church just like their masters did?  Almost no one was mandated to go to church. In some states, like Maryland, religious taxes were imposed on folks were non-Anglican, but this did not force them to go to church. (2)   &gt; I know that lots of indentured servants were poor people from Ireland, many of whom I assume were Catholic, but colonial America was pretty hostile to Catholicism.  Irish, yes, but not exclusively. Also, indentured servitude was on the decline by 1776.  Indentured servants also came from poor parts of of Scotland as well.  But your comments about Anti-Catholism in the colonies is well-founded.  This became a real problem for Catholics, especially in Colonies that originally had high Catholic populations, like Maryland.  But Catholics were forbidden to own churches prior to Marylands Constitution of 1776, so they could not attend church services.  Wealthy Catholics, like the Carroll family (led by Charles Carroll, who represented Maryland at the Constitutional Convention and was a signer of the Declaration of Independence) fought hard for Catholic rights through that era.   &gt;  Did they attend Anglican (or Dissenter) services?  None were forced to. Again, taxes to support Anglican clergy were imposed.   &gt; Another quirk of the southern plantation system was how far apart people lived from each other. Did planters simply have private services in their homes?   Some did.  Charles Carroll's father was known to host church services in his home during this period.  But yes, across the colonies, not just the south, many people lived far from their neighbors.  The census of 1790 shows that 95% of Americans lived outside of towns or cities, that's part of what attributed to such low church membership.    &gt; Again--how could the authorities ""keep track"" of this? I know some planters in South Carolina had a second house in the city, so would they go into town every week? (But if that's the case, what about their slaves and servants?)  As stated above, there were no ""authorities"" who could impose such penalties.  Many American gentry did own houses in some towns, but not all. If they did travel into town, they would typically be accompanied by servants or slaves, but most slaves did not attend church services with their owners.

902	"I'm not exactly well versed in American racial thinking of the era (I'm actually studying this topic in university right now, but we're still at about American Independence.   Essentially, the Arabs were considered an inferior race. That being said, you'd be surprised what was considered an ""inferior race"" at the time.   If you look at how Southern Europeans and Eastern Europeans were treated, you'll realize they were considered inferior races as well. Many prominent and influential racial thinkers of the era, such as Madison Grant, split Humanity into three races: Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. The Caucasoid race was further subdivided into these three: Nordic, Mediterranean, and Alpine.  Basically, he considered Nordic Protestants are the greatest race (most common view at the time), Mediterraneans as second, and Alpine's at the bottom. He acknowledge the great achievements of the Mediterranean race, such as their civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc. and their art, but later also said that many of these were achieved due to interbreeding with Nordics.  Considering that the ""Mediterranean"" race was viewed as lesser, obviously Southern Europeans, Arabs, etc. were greatly hurt by this ideology. In fact, if you look at the statistics, Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Greeks, Chinese, Japanese, and many more ""inferiors"" left as a result of the 1924 legislation than immigrated.  I can't tell you why Southern European immigration was heavily restricted while Arabs were outright banned (although Southern Europeans were *pretty* much banned in practice), but I can only guess this is due to their being un-European or religion. I'm not too confident in this though because various Southern European groups were certainly hated much more than Arabs, especially Italians. Keep in mind that the largest mass lynching (as opposed to massacre!) to ever take place in the US was of Italians (believe it or not)."	human

904	Well proving why something didn't happen is tricky. So it could be more productive to look at why certain colors are used as opposed to why some aren't.  http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Smyth  So some of those are because its an abbreviation for the type of metalworking you specialized in. Black for iron, white for silver etc, with Smith being a general name.  It can also sometimes be a reference to appearance/hair color. ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor ) and isn't confined to just English.   For blonde hair, maybe they simply referred to it as Fair (ie something like Fairchild) and in some other languages ( https://www.houseofnames.com/blonde-family-crest ) would actually be called blond.  As for blue, violet, purple etc there aren't any metals with those colors, nor were they common hair or feature colors for people. This seems a plausible explanation for why more vibrant colors weren't common names, but as I said before proving negatives is almost impossible.	human

907	"Woah, I literally JUST answered a question pretty similar to this.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7v6wmn/the_immigration_act_of_1924_restricted/  Basically, to summarize, many prominent and influential racial thinkers of the era, such as Madison Grant, split Humanity into three races: Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. The Caucasoid race was further subdivided into these three: Nordic, Mediterranean, and Alpine.  Essentially, he considered Nordic Protestants are the greatest race (most common view at the time), Mediterraneans as second, and Alpine's at the bottom. He acknowledge the great achievements of the Mediterranean race, such as their civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc. and their art, but later also said that many of these were achieved due to interbreeding with Nordics.  While not *every* thinker of the time complied to this *exact* theory, *most* were still pretty similar, especially those that subscribed to Nordic Theory.  Considering that the ""Mediterranean"" race (including Southern Europeans, much of the Middle East, much of India, North Africa, etc.) was viewed as lesser, and therefore a ""stain on society"" (commonly being stereotyped with crime and so on), they were obviously heavily discriminated against.  As I mentioned in my answer to the linked thread, the largest mass lynching to ever take place in the US was, surprisingly, of Italians. Italians were so heavily discriminated against that they were forced to resort to crime to support their families. This is why so many Italian crime syndicates and mafias formed.   The situation was similar for the Irish. Keep in mind that the US is historically a Protestant-majority nation as well and, historically, interactions between Protestants and Catholics (Ireland and Italy are mainly Catholic) have been extremely violent. To the Anglo-American mind, Catholicism was a foreign and threatening religion.   During the Mexican-American War, many American soldiers violated Catholic Churches in Mexico. Many of the Irish, being Catholic and obviously against such actions, ended up deserting to the Mexican side in the war. This was only further exacerbated by how the Mexican government used propaganda to deliberately appeal to Catholic-American soldiers. The American's would not forget, and discrimination against Irish Catholics only increased after the war.  Many Americans/British feared that these people, being Catholics, were ultimately loyal to the Pope rather than their country. This was a common criticism brought up to hurt John F. Kennedy's Presidential Campaign (Kennedy being Catholic).   So, it seems like the prominent racial theories of the time and the religious differences both combined, leading to such unjust discrimination and oppression against these peoples. As for your question if they were treated as bad as African-American people. I can't really say for sure, but I'd assume, generally, no. Aside from slavery, Black people also suffered relatively much more segregation. That's not to say that the Irish and Southern Europeans didn't, but, African-Americans, being much more easy to visually distinguish, have been much easier to discriminate against."	human

There's discussion in the talmud of how to convert from the ancient units used in the Torah (cubits, etc) into ""modern"" units like *milin* (Roman miles) and *ris* (Greek stadia).

913	""" They were used on the battlefield in an era where full plate was on its way out beyond ceremonial and tournament use. ""  While hindsight would say that in say, 1520, full armour was approaching its twilight years, at the time people would see many people (*gendarmes*, men at arms, etc - whatever you like to call them) still armed in full plate armour. Indeed, in terms of the quantity (the number and percentage of people equipped with it) and quality (in metallurgy and construction) of armour 1500 or so might have been plate armour's high point.  Both late medieval and early modern battlefields had a combination of armoured and unarmoured people, though to an extent some pikemen may have begun to use their formations as a form of defense rather than heavier armour on their own persons (this is hard to tell - after all, European monarchs also ordered -a lot- of armour for those same pikemen). So your larger point definitely stands - that the two-handed sword was not an armour-piercing weapon used by people who were necessarily looking to fight people in full plate armour and penetrate it. But we should be wary of projecting plate armour's eventual decline backwards into history."	human
914	The feast I had described above took place on Sunday and lasted seven and a half hours; apparently everyone went to bed straight after. The fireworks took place on *Monday* night, a day full of entertainment in the form of dramatic performances, recited Latin orations, and dancing; the chronicler's culinary attention for that day is devoted almost entirely to sculptures made out of sugar. But finally:  &gt; Everyone was led into the square around the first hour and a half of night. The *girandola* hanging in the center of the square was ignited, and when the fuse burned to the end, it exploded in an immense clap of thunder, spewing out vast quantities of flame, smaller explosions, and rockets, that seemed little different from real thunder and lightning.  &gt; *[long description of the very elaborate girandola, shaped like a crown]*  &gt; Hardly had this firework display ended when a tall and handsome float came into the square. It was round, with sixteen sides and eighteen feet high. On top, a cupid with a bow fired arrows with flaming points from a very large silver chariot encircled by fire. About half-way down were twelve or so cherubs who danced around the float with fiery torches encircled with silver. And apart from this, the float contained a great many vases filled with continuously burning fireworks. This fiery float, to much jubilation and everyone's delight, made a tour of practically the whole city.  This is from Jane Bridgeman's translation in *A Renaissance Wedding*.	human
915	"While Korea did switch to Hangul around the mid-15th-Century, Hanja (Chinese characters) remained the primary means of writing and printing virtually all official documents, newspapers, books, etc., until the 20th Century. (Wilkinson, p. 911) Perhaps as a result, or partially as a result, printing did not take off in Korea until long after the advent of Hangul.   The first ""modern"" printing press seems to have been introduced into Korea by the Japanese in the early 1880s, as articles were written about Korea's ""first"" newspaper printing, which was a Japanese-controlled paper called ""Chosen Shinpo"" and appears to have had its first issue around 1881.

916	"Parents--mothers and fathers alike--took the deaths of their children quite hard. This might seem like a ""duh"" statement, but for a long time, there was a prominent strand of scholarship that argued the opposite--high mortality rates meant parents refused to invest in their children emotionally until somewhere in toddlerhood. More recent work has demonstrated this to be as a blanket statement utterly untrue. Elisheva Baumgarten turned up legal/religious advice cases from the Rhineland (Ashkenaz) Jewish community that implore Jewish fathers to stop crying so much and acting like women over the deaths of their children.   As for coping? There's one completely heartbreaking ritual/miracle legend that arose specifically in the Latin Christian community for stillborn babies or babies who died during/right after birth. In medieval Christian theology, humans needed baptism to cleanse them of original sin; otherwise they were bound for hell if they died. Yes, completely innocent babies (since they were not actually innocent). Various emergency measures developed to deal with this, such as authorizing midwives to perform the sacrament of baptism in the most dire cases. But sometimes all really was lost. So the ""miraculous resurrection"" developed--the midwife, or may even one of the parents, would claim the stillborn child suddenly came to life! JUST long enough for it to be taken to a nearby shrine and baptized, at which point God took its soul securely to *heaven*.  Both Jewish and Christian religious teaching also used the language and stories of martyrdom to try to teach parents to cope with potential grief over lost children. In Judaism, attention focused on the women martyrs killed by the First Crusaders in their pogroms across Germany. These women were renowed not just for ""sanctifying the name of the Lord"" themselves, but for putting their own sons and daughters, teenagers and infants, to the sword *first* so the Christian knights would not kidnap them, have them baptized, and raise them as Christian. Parents were encouraged to see a greater religious purpose in the loss of children. Christians relied on a standard trope in saints' and martyrs' lives: the need to leave (living) children behind in order to worship God to the best of their ability. This might mean Perpetua breastfeeding her son one last time before joyfully going to her martyrdom in the arena; it might mean the litany of women saints who left their children with their own parents and wandered into the desert to become monks. Medieval religious teaching did not encourage imitation of these *behaviors*. It encouraged emulation of the *ideal* of separation from earthly attachment to focus on God."	human
917	There's no reason to suppose Anglo-Saxons treated their slaves overall much better than Americans... there was no wergeld/death-price for a slave. On the other hand, since slavery was not race-based, it was not unheard of for slaves to be set free (manumitted). An example might be a person who couldn't pay a debt becoming the slave of the person to whom they owned money, but only until the value of their work reached the value of the debt.  By 1100 or so slaves were maybe as many as a quarter of all people in England.  I've seen some scholarly articles on slavery in Anglo-Saxon England, but apart from an enslaved boy becoming a king, and mentions in some poems, and drawings in the margins of books, the Anglo-Saxon slaves didn't leave us with a large body of social history.  We do know that metal collars and forged manacles and chains were used, at least sometimes.  Part of the culture of slave-owners in North America, though, was people who fled Europe to try and do better for themselves, and this focus on self-interest, combined with the racial side of black slavery, might have led to greater cruelty. But that's speculation on my part.	human

919	A couple of items worth noting:  A) While the Latin alphabet is simple, what Gutenberg printed was not just 25 characters. He was trying to replicate calligraphy, which meant there were a wide variety of character variants. If I recall correctly (I’ll need to find the project), an attempt to replicate his Bible found some 30 or so variants of the letter ‘a’. While no Chinese, it still would have taken a lot of time! Obviously, once Roman-letter printing became more common, this was simplified greatly and became cheaper / faster.   B) Gutenberg was not the first to invent metal moveable type. That was done in Korea, supposedly in the 1200s. Unfortunately, the book which supposedly was printed in metal no longer exists, so the oldest extant metal printed book dates to 1377 (the Jikji). [Wikipedia covers this point well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#Metal_movable_type_in_Korea) (and provides a couple of references). The metal type was primary created via bronze sand-casting. The traditional methods are still practiced at the [Early Printing Museum](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr:1001/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=797950) in Cheongju. When last in Korea, I saw an exhibit of metal type at the National Museum—it was really impressive to see the massive number of metal type!  The primary limitation in Korean book production was the printing technique and paper. All printing was done by hand (no printing press like Gutenberg), and could only be done on one side of the paper due to the ink absorption of the substrate. As a result, it was a much slower, and more expensive process than Gutenberg’s.   C) On your point of “preventing the press from being widespread even after the adoption of Hangeul as the official alphabet of the Kingdom”, Hangeul was only actually adopted as the official script in the late 1890s, primarily as a nationalistic response than a desire to switch to a more efficient script. By that point, there were much larger issues at hand than cultural elitism (such as the Japanese colonial aggression).  D) It is also worth noting that Korea suffered from hardship at the hands of repeated Japanese invasions during the preceding centuries, especially those of Hideyoshi, in which printing materials were stolen and brought back to Japan. For example, at the Jeonju printing museum, I recall a painting depicting the royal printers carrying the royal archive and printing equipment on horseback north to escape the advancing Japanese army.   E) So what did Gutenberg really do? Like you said, he brought together a set of technologies that enabled rapid, cheap printing. So when the Christian missionaries came to East Asia (the primary Christian printer for Korea was actually based in Yokohama), they were able to produce materials quickly. Their typefaces weren't very good quality, but the speed was unmatched.   I don't have access to my sources at the moment (and some of them are museums I've been to), but I'd be happy to look up references for any of the items mentioned above. 	human

923	"Thought not quite the Middle Ages, two poems by the excellent Elizabethan poet Ben Johnson might be instructive for your question.   The first, he wrote after his son, Benjamin, died at the age of seven:  *Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;*  *My sin was too much hope of thee, lov'd boy.*  *Seven years tho' wert lent to me, and I thee pay,*  *Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.*  *O, could I lose all father now! For why*  *Will man lament the state he should envy?*  *To have so soon 'scap'd world's and flesh's rage,*  *And if no other misery, yet age?*  *Rest in soft peace, and, ask'd, say, ""Here doth lie*  *Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry.""*  *For whose sake henceforth all his vows be such,*  *As what he loves may never like too much.*  You can see the many different coping mechanisms he uses in just these few lines: putting the fault on himself for hoping too much for his son, saying it's a good thing that his son has managed to escape all the evils of the world, trying to learn a lesson about loving/liking too strongly, etc. Clearly the death of this child deeply affected Johnson, who was otherwise rather commonly a poet of rather cynical and somewhat sarcastic tone.  And here is a poem he wrote on the death of his first daughter, Mary, at six months:  *Here lies, to each her parents’ ruth,*  *Mary, the daughter of their youth;*  *Yet all heaven’s gifts being heaven’s due,*  *It makes the father less to rue.*  *At six months’ end she parted hence*  *With safety of her innocence;*  *Whose soul heaven’s queen, whose name she bears,*  *In comfort of her mother’s tears,*  *Hath placed amongst her virgin-train:*  *Where, while that severed doth remain,*  *This grave partakes the fleshly birth;*  *Which cover lightly, gentle earth!*  A somewhat less heartbreaking, but nevertheless painful poem, which, again, showcases some of the coping mechanisms he must have tried to use in his own mind.   Clearly, it must have been difficult, indeed, for parents in earlier times to deal with the deaths of young children, and they likely turned to whatever outlets they could to cope. In Johnson's case, that was his art."	human

934	As a foreigner, my experience is that writing is pretty easy, but reading is hard.   The actual writing of characters is just practice. They’re all made up of parts called radicals and there’s rules for the order that can make it pretty easy. So when I look at a character, even one I’ve never written, I can write it pretty well. The problem is memorizing the sound and meaning with it. If you can’t read a character, you have to either ask someone or look it up.   There have been occasions where I can read every character in a sentence but not understand what they mean together! 	human

But treating the Western culture as a default is precisely the problem I'm raising - with this whole thread, not just your response, which clearly answered the question the OP was asking.  Throughout history (excluding prehistory) a majority of the world's population has been Asian. And Asians typically did not adopt Western dress until quite recently (and it's still not a clear norm in South Asia). I *don't* have the requisite knowledge to answer this question, but AFAIK, Asians typically regarded Europeans as having poor hygiene and cleanliness habits. So the distinction may well be significant.  I'm suggesting that the knowledgeable people who respond on this subreddit should be actively opposing the deplorable habit of treating Euro-culture as representative of history - especially when so many questions here appear to demonstrate a belief (conscious or unconscious) in Western 'exceptionalism.' 	human
936	The short answer is probably that no one cared to make the language easier for outsiders to learn, and it's very efficient for them to communicate between each other. The alphabet equivalents do exist, but are only used for teaching purposes.  From what I've gathered talking to people from China and Taiwan and a bit of experience learning the language myself:  1.) It's not really a problem for native speakers who grew up learning the characters; they're pretty much literate sometime in elementary school. It is certainly a pain for foreigners.  2.) You can express very complex ideas in very few characters, so in a way you can think of the Chinese language as basically compressed to contain more information per character or syllable. There's a study about this at the syllable level that you might be able to find somewhere; [here's a summary](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fast-talkers/).  3.) As an extension of the compression idea, there's often a whole new layer of meaning that you'll only understand if you grew up in their schools and learned the context and back-stories.

942	His previous friendliness with the Nazis and supportive statements about them, and his support for the America First movement to keep the US out of WWII, among other things, made him a personal and political enemy of FDR, who blocked him.  Lest that sound like an anamoly, there were those inside the FDR administration and out (Joe Kennedy for example) who had similarly been friendly or even supportive of the Nazis prior to WWII, some toned it down when such things became officially a no-no after 1936, so did not and found themselves on the outs.  Ultimately, it was Lindbergh's very public political activism as part of the American First crowd (and his association with Henry Ford) that earned him the ire of FDR, as that was linked to the Republicans and political opposition to his administration and FDRs re-election /campaign for a third term.   Incidentally, Lindbergh ended up getting a contractor position in the Pacific and local units allowed him to fly combat missions (as a civilian). When FDR became aware of it, Lindbergh was recalled back to the US and eventually went to work in the defense industry.  Source: Nearly every biographer of Lindbergh covers this, but you may also find Lynne Olson's Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941 to be illuminating. 	human
943	"Fascism is notoriously (and somewhat surprisingly) difficult to define precisely as an ideology. Nazism also underwent a series of changes over time that makes it hard to pin down completely, as it was different things at different times, especially before it became tied to Hitler as it's personification, though even Mein Kampf underwent revisions over time.  Anatomy of Fascism by Robert Paxton gives a pretty good overview of the scholarship on the subject of fascism, which is a deep, broad, and contentious area of political and historical study with only pockets of consensus.    You may also use the term ""Rise of Nazis"" in a book search - there are at least a dozen or so books with that in the title, most of which cover the relevant areas of your question, though each from somewhat differing academic/historical perspectives and/or source material.

944	In pop music criticism in the 21st century - which also effectively serves as the historiography of pop music history - there has been a massive pushback against the particular assumptions of authenticity of rock and roll.   The book *Faking It* by Hugh Barker and Yuval Taylor contrasts Neil Young - a man commonly considered to have rock authenticity - with Billy Joel - a man commonly derided by those who value authenticity in rock. Both of them are of the same generation and their songs are actually quite similar thematically, argue the authors. However, Billy Joel plays piano and writes accomplished, well-crafted songs with influences from musical theatre, and sings with some polish. Neil Young, on the other hand, plays guitar and writes songs that are not particularly well-crafted, but which feel like he has a certain access to his subconscious. As a singer, Young is limited, with a nasal tenor. And all of these things denote authenticity - given his limitations, Young has to mean it when he plays, because he’s not good enough to fake it. However, in *Faking It*, Barker and Taylor argue that all pop musicians, essentially - both Joel and Young - fake it. Authenticity is in the minds of the audience, not in the music, per se.  And the things that a given group of people find to be authentic is revealing. There’s a group of soul fans who consistently fail to see Motown as soul *at all* - it’s too white, too Northern, too upwardly mobile, too aimed at the mainstream audiences. It doesn’t have the grit of the Stax records of Otis Redding and Sam And Dave, etc, it’s too sweetened. For these people, the authenticity of soul is attached to its lack of refinement. And this is something that consistently runs through views on much black music - the rawer, the more sexual and basic, the better. When of course, African-American composers have composed lots of beautiful, complex, refined music that also deserves to be celebrated. What these people are looking for, often, in African-American music, is a sort  of yin to the yang, a them to the us, a receptacle for the feelings they’re not comfortable with in themselves.  But this is something that’s not really in the music; it’s in people’s heads. Stax’s music was highly refined in certain ways that are perhaps less obvious than Motown’s. And Motown certainly features tons of monstrous performances - Levi Stubbs was one hell of a singer, and as much as Marvin Gaye wanted to be a crooner, there was also part of him that could really let loose.   So it’s probably the rule that - with music, at least - anything that you find inauthentic says more about you than about the music per se.   Pop music is always a careful construction and it’s always mediated by commerce - it’s in the name of the genre. And by pop music I also mean hip-hop, rock, metal, Americana, whatever. In this day and age it’s often easier to make music that’s relatively shiny than music that has just the right amount of sounding a bit lo-fi (I mean, everyone has GarageBand or the like on their computers/tablets, or can get it). That band on an indie label mostly leaves to join a major label not because they really want to sell out, but because they eventually realise that labels are all the same and that the indie label will screw you over too. The things that you notice as being authentic or inauthentic - out of the myriad of ways in which the music becomes untrue to the deepest heart of the musician, and the way it’s mediated by culture and society and perceptions of what will be a hit, etc, etc - are...interesting.   Ultimately, the things that ended up being seen as authentic in pop music discourse for much of the second half of the 20th century reflected the values of white middle-class masculinity - both the positive and healthy values of that, and the negative and ugly ones.   With that in mind, it’s interesting to think about the question: Why is *that* thing that’s inauthentic - out of all the ways a piece of music is not really ‘authentic’ - why is that one the one that stands out to you?	human

949	"You're right that this fascination with the Templars can seem a bit strange at first. They weren't the most successful military order (holy order is a misnomer, it doesn't actually describe a group like the Templars or Hospitallers, military order or military-religious order is the normal term). The Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights both established their own states. The Hospitallers only demilitarised in 1798. Up to 1918 the Teutonic Order fielded a regiment in the Austro-Hungarian army. Both orders are still around today. In contrast, the Templars existed for just under two centuries and never founded their own order-state.  The biggest factor that makes the Templars a greater presence in the popular imagination than these other orders is the Temple's suppression. They weren't ""just another"" order dissolved by the Papacy. The Templars were the first international military order to be suppressed and the only one to be dissolved on charges of heresy and after years of trials. Nothing like this had happened on such a scale before. The Order's end then allows for pseudohistory and conspiracy theories. What if some Templars got away? Was there a conspiracy against them? What if the Order still survives in secret? (it doesn't). Such stories are more difficult to create and spread when we know that an order survived, like the Hospitallers, or when few people know about another suppressed order. Who's heard of the Hospital of St Thomas of Acre? It's this dramatic end that is most important for the Templars' continued presence in the popular imagination, providing a memorable story and allowing for myriad myths and conspiracy theories to arise in the centuries after, further contributing to the popularity of the Templars.   In addition to this, the Templars were the first military order. The Hospitallers were founded earlier, but did not militarise until after the Temple was founded. They fought in every major engagement of the Holy Land crusades, which is the still the period of the crusades with the largest presence in pop history and pop culture. If someone reads a pop history on the crusades, it's going to have the Templars. The Hospitallers would probably also get a mention, but more minor orders like the Lazarites probably won't.  Also, the Templars were an important presence in medieval Britain and Ireland, owning many estates and acting as servants to the English and Scottish kings. The royal almoner in Scotland was traditionally a Templar. In England the brethren acted as royal financiers and diplomats. The English master of the Temple, Aimery of St Maur, was even a witness to the Magna Carta. They were fully part of the economic and political history of the medieval British Isles. For English-speakers, this increases awareness of the Templars and makes them more relevant to English-language pop history and pop culture than orders like the Teutonic Knights, Livonian Order, Knights of Santiago, Knights of Calatrava, and other orders that had no presence there. As pop culture is dominated by America, which largely draws upon English history when engaging with the medieval period, it's unsurprising that the Spanish or German orders are less prominent.  All of these factors have combined to create an order that had a dramatic and sudden end ripe for conspiracy theories, a prominent position in the best-known episodes of the crusades, and a greater relevance to English-speakers than more regional orders. Considering this, it isn't too surprising that the Templars are a much bigger presence in the popular imagination (in the Anglosphere, at least) than the other military orders."	human
950	Don’t know about Middle Ages, but a high mortality rate of the mother giving birth continued into the late 1800’s until a Dr. Semmelweis came up with a radical solution—have the doctors and staff wash their hands! When he had them wash with chlorinated lime before examining the women, the rate dropped from 10% down to 2 or 1 or 0 each month. What’s interesting, the medical community in Austria and Europe mocked his hand-washing idea and didn’t use it. Years went by with Dr. Semmelweis attempting to convince others. It wasn’t until after his death that his findings were accepted and implemented. In the meantime, thousands of women died needlessly.	human

955	"Yes. There are broadly three stages of Chinese evolution past the Oracle stone (甲骨文) origins:   1. Unification of writing. This happened with Qin dynasty accompanying the end of the Warring States (战国). In short, there were many ways of writing a single character prior, and a single form of writing was born from it.  2. The simplification of the characters. This happened with Mao's Communist Party after taking over China in 1945. The result is simplified Chinese (简体字), as opposed to traditional Chinese (繁体字).  3. Finally, and around the same time as #2, the pronunciation of Chinese was standardized. The standard version was derived from Beijing Chinese, with the ""er"" emphasises separated out into its own character. When someone says ""Chinese"" today, they are referring to this version. It is also commonly, but erroneously, referred to as Mandarin, as it is a version that's artificially created and not organically evolved. From this, pinyin was popularized, which uses the Romantic alphabet to approximate the sounds. Today, there are still other dialects around, such as Cantonese; but they are becoming more and more irrelevant. There is only one official Chinese and it's used by 99% of Chinese.  Today:  1. Nearly all Chinese is typed using pinyin 2. Nearly all written Chinese uses the simplified version (though converting to traditional is just a font change) 3. All Chinese speakers can communicate freely with each other in written form, even though they might not understand each other verbally due to regional accents"	human
956	"In theory, any island that falls outside the territorial waters of any nation can be annexed by its discoverer, and history is full of examples of this happening.   Annexation is a unilateral act which has to be performed by on on behalf of a government, not an individual. It is also one that, in international law, depends on two principles: *discovery* and *occupation*. Discovering an island but failing to occupy it ""effectively"" does not constitute sovereignty, and it can and does leave a territory vulnerable to later rediscovery and occupation by another power – as the tangled history of territorial claims over the Falkland Islands/Malvinas amply demonstrates.   A leading case here is the dispute over the island of Palmas, near the Philippines, which was claimed by both the US and the Netherlands. The US claim was based on  the discovery of the island by Spanish mariners, which it contended meant it was under Spanish sovereignty when the Philippines were transferred to US control in 1898. However, arbitration in 1925 awarded the island to the Netherlands on the grounds that Palmas had long been ""continuously and peacefully"" occupied by representatives of the Dutch government.  An interesting article covering international law as it refers to new landmasses that emerge as a result of geological action is Mark Dingle's ""[Eruptions in international law: emerging volcanic islands and the law of territorial acquisition](http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;context=cilj),"" in *Cornell International Law Journal* 11 (1978)"	human

"	human
960	The roman legions broke the dominance of the Phalanx. In the beginning, the Romans also used the Phalanx, but they developed the classic 'large shield and short sword' style specifically to deal with the Phalanx. The Phalanx worked by having men in heavy armor face the same direction, stick out the spear and then push your shield in the back of the guy in front of you and then push. There was basically only one direction a Phalanx could move without trouble, and that was forward. If a soldier fell or got wounded he had to remain in the front and hope he wasn't trampled to death by his ever forward pushing comrades in arms. If they wanted to change the heading they had to lift their long spears, and they were generally packed so tight that it was a problem to move at all. And the heavy shields were only meant to defend yourself, fighting in unison with others was was harder with them because of the weight and shape.  Legionnaires on the other hand fought in less heavy gear, had a lighter shield that could be combined with other shields seamlessly and the short sword could stab through gaps in the wall and that were opened for a moment and then closed. Lances didn't scare them, because they could use the shields for cover. If they got injured, they could go through the gaps between manipels and hurry back. Fresh troops could be rotated in while the battle raged. Not carrying the heavy lance meant that you could carry throwing spears and lead pieces or daggers that were meant to bury into the enemies shield, making them impossible to use. Without the shield, the lance carrier was at a big disadvantage. And these projectiles were thrown from the back rows during the combat. If you wanted, you could order an entire legion to run back a few meters, switch places, throw stuff and charge again. The comparative light weight of the Roman equipment meant that they could do maneuvers that the Phalanx simply could not counter. And training gave them a variety of tactics to handle different situations on the battlefield that the Phalanx only had very few solutions to, mainly 'charge', 'hold fast' and 'withdraw', with the latter two being made very hard by the constant press from behind and the tightness of the battle lines.	human

962	Keep in mind that, even if we assume that within a given kingdom a King will be richer than a Duke (this was not always the case, there were kingdoms with highly autonomous nobles where a single noble could arguably be stronger than the actual king), obviously some dukedoms would be richer than entire kingdoms.   To use a rather loose modern comparison, the governor of, say, California (who has authority over only a portion of the United States), still has authority over a greater number of people and more tax revenue than the head of state of many countries. 	human
963	Solid history doesn’t answer the question of why they are so popular.   Scholars and academics don’t want to dignify this pseudo-history with published responses.   The Holy Grail crap became really popular in the early 1980’s with [Holy Blood, Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Blood_and_the_Holy_Grail?wprov=sfti1) .  It was mostly based on a French book published sometime in the late 1960s.   Holy Blood, Holy Grail was widely read by the public and quickly absorbed in to the Conspiracy Theory Canon.    The Da Vinci Code was basically a novelization of Holy Blood, Holy Grail.	human
964	There was a lot of complicated history at play, but roughly speaking there were two main concerns: that a Catholic monarch may attempt to impose Catholicism upon an increasingly Protestant population, and that a Catholic monarch would fall under the influence of foreign powers.

Over time as the population became more Protestant the first issue began to become less of a threat, but the second grew. In particular there was a lot of speculation that a Catholic monarch would become a puppet of the French, who at the time were a frequent enemy of the English/British.	human

966	"""Replacement"" is not an accurate term to use in the evolution of warfare, especially ancient warfare. ""Replacement"" assumes that everyone is operating from the same playbook, and that changing from a phalangite-based martial system to a sword and shield martial system was a conscious or deliberate choice, like upgrading a tech tree in Civilization, or something. The reality is much different. I'm going to try to unpack it a little bit.  1: Organized violence is social, and militaries are an expression of a social structure with economic particulars.  If we take the example of ""Greek Hoplite"" in its most generic possible sense, we get a pretty common image: a man with a bronze helmet with a crest, a round, bowl-like shield, a cuirass of metal or cloth, greaves, sandals, a spear. We all know the image from pop culture and are likely conversant with some of the details, like superficial knowledge that a man dressed like this fights in a phalanx. We might even have an opinion on *how* they fought, and specifically how they used their spears, or didn't use their spears.  That's all well and good, but remember that there is an entire society behind that phalangite, there are details of that man's upbringing, ideas that he has about what makes a man a *man*, about what makes that man a *citizen*, perhaps about what makes that *citizen* a *warrior*.   Now picture another man. He's similar in all of the broad details: he too wears a helmet, has armor for his shins and chest and carries a shield. But this shield is shaped differently; it's rectangular rather than circular, and the ends along its long axis curve inward giving it some complexity. And instead of a spear, he carries a sword.  He too has assumptions about *manhood* and *citizenship*, has an idea about what makes a *warrior*. Some of them overlap with our generic Greek warrior. Some of them are radically different.   Behind both men is a society of craftsmen, makers, builders, traders and laborers creating and distributing all of the tools that he takes with him to war. That society makes up the majority of decisions with regard to how that man fights. Spear, sword, *aspis* or *scutum*: neither of these men can go to a market and decide that he will mix and match or agonizes about the damage-type he can inflict with a spear versus a sword: he takes with him what his society deems practicable for battlefield use.  We can do this exercise with any warrior from history or even any warrior from our imagination: even the most mundane details of a warrior's kit reflects decisions, traditions, and economic advantages and disadvantages that are shared on a societal level.   2: Military developments aren't linear, and changes don't necessarily imply superiority  Modern folks have a tendency to assume that anything newer is better. And while that's certainly the case with, like, iPhones, that does not carry over into military history or the history of technology. One axiom that we can be sure of, though, is that changes reflect challenges on a social or economic level, and that their expression in new equipment or tactics or what-have-you are a visible attempt at problem-solving.  Most of the time, the problems will be overcome with solutions that offer as little disruption as possible. Temporary alliances against an invader are one example, since an alliance with rivals who nevertheless share a culture, language, and ethos is socially non-disruptive. Now, on a military level, there are more available soldiers to fight the invader, but socially and economically very few changes have been made.  In the case of Rome and Greece, while both sides made small changes to their tactics and equipment over several hundred years, when they met on the battlefield, neither was making rapid changes. That Romans consistently won battles is a question more about tactics, strategy, and the application of their social and economic advantages (which affect recruitment and retention of soldiers, motivation to fight, the availability of supply and equipment, and how a society shares the cost of maintaining an army). On an individual basis, if this were a question posed to something like *Deadliest Warrior*, skill or advantage in their kit doesn't matter a whole lot, because wars are fought between *societies and cultures*, not individual warriors.  To tl;dr this point: just because a single society makes changes to their approach to combat doesn't mean that those changes reflect some objective improvement, it just means that those changes reflect an effort to solve problems posed by some external or internal force.  If you have a question more specific about a particular example of changing weapons and tactics, please ask here. I will answer if it falls into my area of knowledge, or can refer you to other answers in the FAQ."	human
967	I'm not sure what you mean. Certainly, there are about as many myths about the Templars as there are grains of sand, but it's probably a fool's errand to ascribe their origin to particular circumstances.

968	Before a historian brings a more authoritative explanation on the subject, I'd like to direct you to the Battle of Cynoscephalae as a quintessential example of the situational superiority of the Roman legion over the Macedonian phalangites.

970	"Purgatory has a close connection with people's concern for deceased family members, going all the way back to the early Church martyrs! However, theologically speaking, its function isn't the best fit for the unbaptized infants problem.  In medieval Christinaity (and modern Catholicism), purgatory is sort of like the unpleasant entry hallway of heaven. It's the place where you do penance for your sins so you are ""clean"" (purgation) enough to enter paradise. This means that you did not have time on Earth to complete the penance for the sins you confessed. See, ""confession"" (the sacrament of Reconciliation today) is always talked about in three parts in medieval preaching: contrition, confession, penance. You have to be sorry you messed up, you have to confess your sins and ideally be absolved by a priest, and you have to do penance to pay the penalty for the sin even though the *guilt* has been washed away by absolution.  So purgatory is only for those who have been absolved of the guilt of sin but still have penalty to pay. Unbaptized infants, in this stark view (It Got Better), are not eligible for purgatory because they are still innately guilty of original sin.  However. Because this seemed as heartless to grieving medieval communities as it does to us, they invented an *unofficial* afterlife zone for unbaptized babies! This is ""limbo."" Limbo does not have the joyous beatific vision of God, but it's not hell--there is no suffering.

973	Yes, like with all politics throughout History there were scandals in Nazi Germany surrounding Politicians and Military Commanders. Some of the scandals were heavily covered up by the party apparatus, while others were blown out of proportion to vilify and degrade the person in question.  There were many scandals, including cheating, drugs etc… The highest ranking Nazi that had a problem getting caught up in scandals was Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Joseph Goebbels, as Reich Minister of Propaganda basically rain the Nazi’s film industry, and with that, had access and control over the careers of many talented and attractive actresses. He had a supposedly loving and loyal *Aryan* wife back home, named Magda Goebbels, but like many men in power (and in general) Goebbels could not resist the temptation of cheating on his wife. He cheated on his wife with his Austrian-Czech actress Mistress Lída Baarová. Within the Nazi inner circles Goebbels’ was a known philanderer and had a penchant for some of his leading actresses. However, he tried covering up his extra marital affairs. This particular affair caught Adolf Hitler’s attention.  Hitler basically forbade Goebbels from having an affair with a “Czech Actress”, because it went against the Nazi racial and marital morals. Goebbels of course continued his affair, but by late 1938 the Berlin Police, and then Gestapo got involved and basically told Goebbels and Barrová to cease and desist seeing eachother.  She fled back to her native Prague. The Gestapo kept close tabs of her in Prague, but eventually she left for Italy in 1942, where she continued performing – but still under close watch.  Another possible mistress of Goebbels’ was Olga Chekhova (born Olga Knipper) who was a Russian-German actress. The irony behind this is that Olga Chekhova married a Russian Jewish actor named Mikhail Checkhov, but their marriage only lasted a few years – but she still kept his last name. There is only scant evidence to support this claim. However, it was known that Olga Chekhova did sleep with various high ranking Nazi officials. There is a picture of her sitting next to Adolf Hitler, and many conspiracy theorists believe that she was a possible mistress of Hitler’s. However, this particular theory was undoubtedly started by the Soviets, away to both shame Hitler, and as a way to extort her to spy on the Nazis. Again, there is scant evidence to support the last bit about her spying for the Soviet NKVD, but it is possible. A well regarded Historian, Roger Moorhouse briefly wrote about it in his book “Killing Hitler” (*and I am a fan of his writings, and have used him as sources in other posts I’ve made on this sub forum*).  Regardless, Goebbels certainly had many extramarital affairs and kept longstanding mistresses – to the chagrin of the Nazi hierarchy and of course his wife.  There is of course also evidence to suggest that Goebbels’ *loyal Aryan* wife was also cheating on him, with Karl Hanke. Hanke at the end of the war was basically the equivalent to the Governor of the German state of Lower Silesia, and then took over for Heinrich Himmler as Reichsführer-SS in the last week of the war.   The biggest irony behind Goebbels philandering is it was most often with women that he himself would probably have viewed as racially inferior; a Czech-Austrian woman, and a Russian-German divorcee’ who kept her Russian Jewish ex-husband’s surname. So yes, out of all of Nazi Germany’s inner societal scandals, this was probably the most ironic, and most blatant. Of course you also had Hermann Göring (Famously known for being the Head of the Luftwaffe, but also held many high ranking government positions) who was a well-known drug abuser, and a well-known *Dandy* who enjoyed overly extravagant luxuries, even as the world around him came crumbling down. Heinrich Himmler towards the end of the war was on one hand ramping up the Holocaust, and on the other hand was trying to open channels to negotiate favorable surrender (to spare his own life, and standing) with the Swedes and the Swiss, and at one point even the World Jewish Congress. The Minister of Armaments Albert Speer (Hitler’s favorite architect and friend) fragrantly disobeyed Hitler’s Nero Orders at the end of the war, to totally destroy Germany in a Scorch Earth Policy – if Germany could not win, it would go down in flames. That was a big scandal that personally pissed off Hitler. There were of course many more scandals. Many of the upper echelon of Nazi society had affairs, did drugs, disobeyed Hitler’s orders, and at the end of the war tried saving their asses. An evil regime that prided itself on purity and everyone working together for the greater good of their country, and their ideology, was rife with personal scandal and utter hypocrisy. 	human
974	“Kit” is a military term used in European countries to mean “gear” basically. It’s not just weapons, but any tools or gear a soldier might carry. 	human
975	In short: No. Barbara Tuchman is a bit of an interesting case because she was never professionally trained as a historian, but as a journalist. Although a lack of professional training may make it harder to get work, it also allows flexibility between disciplines (especially if you're established as a more freelance writer without restriction). Most professional historians work in pretty narrow fields. For example, a historian of modern France will generally do work between 1750 to the present and even then will deal with a common set of issues (although this can vary).   For example, one historian I know (Laura Frader) has worked on topics ranging from labor history in provincial France to the formation of the welfare state and European integration between the 1870s and 1970s, but she focuses on gender as the subject of her analysis in all of these works. Others may work more closely on specific topics like the rise of the far right, the age of world wars, or agricultural history, but most are quite narrow in focus. Interests tend to shift as a career goes on, but they generally stay in the same field unless they do outside training (say in other methods or disciplines).	human

978	"&gt; Thanks for the response. Sorry I was confusing. I must be conflating information in my head--probably because so much of the information I find is about New England.   There's a ton of misinformation out there on Early American religion.   &gt; everyone had to pay taxes to support the Anglican church, and to hold public office in the south you had to be Anglican.   Only in some parts of the country did you explicitely have to be Anglican.  Most laws preventing people from holding office due to religious preference usually had to do with preventing certain religions rather than only allowing Anglicans. In some places, they simply outlawed non-Christians (mainly Jews) or outlawed specific branches of Christianity (like catholics). Also, some states adopted the practice of requiring religious oaths or tests, that prevented some minorities, like Quakers from taking office.    &gt; Is there anything else that non-Anglicans were not allowed to do?  What types of things are you refering to? There was definitely a religious struggle between minority religions and the Anglican faith during the 18th century. As far as laws barring people from doing certain activities, well that would be uncommon.  Culturally, there was plenty of push back against non-Anglicans in the colonies that presented challenges for them. For instance, in Maryland, there was a real struggle between Catholics who wanted formal recognition as being religiously equal to Anglicans, but there was tons of resistance to that.  This ended up leading to a series of debates between two prominant political figures in the state exchanging harsh words through the Maryland Gazette in 1773.  The ""[First Citizen and Antilon debate](https://www.amazon.com/Maryland-Empire-1773-Antilon-Bicentennial/dp/0801815479)"" between Charles Carroll of Carrollton and Daniel Dulany were a series of letters exchanged by the two, initially about Dulany defending the governor's right to impose taxes without going through the state legislature, but quickly turned into debates over religion. Dulany (an anglican) disparaged Catholics as being ""Papists"" or only having loyalty to the Pope and Carroll pushing back and saying that Catholics can show loyalty to their homeland as well.

979	&gt; wars are fought between societies and cultures  Was this true throughout history? What (little) I've learned about war throughout history is that the idea of mobilizing an entire population/society/culture to support a war didn't start until the French Revolutionary Wars. Before wars were rather limited and didn't involve mobilizing a whole country behind the war effort.	human
980	"There is a fair amount of evidence - generally in the form of graffiti left by visitors - that more or less organised tourism to Egyptian monuments did take place, by both Greek and Latin speaking visitors, during this period of Egyptian history. Herodotus and Strabo both mention seeing ""inscriptions"" on he outside of the pyramids (on casing stones that have since been destroyed or re-used in construction in Cairo), and these are more usually guessed to have been ancient graffiti than hieroglyphics left by the original builders. Strabo, who visited in 24 BC, describes them as written in letters that were ""like Greek,"" but which were no longer readable. Abu Mothaffer, writing before 1250 AD, mentions seven different sorts of graffiti, in Greek, Arabic, Syriac, Musnadic, Hebrew, Rumi and Persian, and William of Baldensal (1336) mentions inscriptions in Latin.   The British Egyptologist William Flinders Petrie, writing in 1883, conducted his own survey of the remaining graffiti visible at Giza and concluded:  &gt;Among the hundreds of pieces of casing stones that I have looked over, very few traces of inscription were to be seen; this was, however, to be expected, considering the pieces nearly all belonged to the upper casing stones, out of the reach of mere travellers. Three examples of single letters were found, two Greek and one unknown; ad on the W. side, in one of the excavations, a piece was discovered bearing three graffiti, one large one attracting lesser scribblers, as in modern times. The earliest inscription was probably of Ptolemy X, showing portions of [six Greek letters]; the next was Romano-Greek of a certain M A P K I O C K... When one considered the large number of graffiti that are to be seen on every ancient building of importance, it seems almost impossible that the Great Pyramid – one of the most renowned and visited of all – should not have been similarly covered with ancient scribbles.""  There are also words written in the soot left by torches on the ceiling of the subterranean chamber of the Great Pyramid, and numerous inscriptions on the base of one of the two ""Colossi of Memnon"", further up the Nile, which was associated with a miraculous sound, appearing to emanate from the ruined monument at sunrise, which was heard by some visitors to the site. It's not clear whether the soot inscriptions date so far back as the Roman period. One mentioned by Caviglia, which he read as ""I AM E R"" and thought to be Roman, more likely records a visit by I. A. Mercator in 1563. The inscriptions on the statue of ""Memnon"" at Abu Simbel often record not only the names of visitors but the dates they visited and whether or not they heard the mysterious sound - for example: I, Caecilia Tribulla, wrote after hearing Memnon here."" and ""I heard the wonderful Memnon along with my wife... and my children... 11 Choiak, 15th year of Hadrian"" [that is, 7 December 130].  In addition, we have accounts by both Herodotus and Diadorus Succulus, describing their visits to Giza. Both state that they were accompanied by guides who recounted traditions concerning the building of the pyramids, which suggests the existence of a fairly well-organised, and commonly used, tourism infrastructure dating to at least as early as the 5th century BC.  **Sources**  William Flinders Petrie, *The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh* (1993)  Rupert Gould, *Enigmas: Another Book of Unexplained Facts* (1929)  Peter Keegan, *Graffiti in Antiquity* (2014)  I went into more detail about the preservation of Egyptian structures, and about ancient tourism in Egypt, [in an earlier thread on repairs to the pyramids and other monuments, here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ltbnq/in_the_time_of_cleopatra_were_the_pyramids_still/), which includes other sources."	human
981	It's my understanding that to most degrees the spear was never truly supplanted by the sword in a meaningful way *in general*.  The cheapest form of hand-to-hand weapon has been the spear and it is substantially easier to teach the motions necessary - moving more toward your economics statement. I was of the understanding that the spear in some form or another remained the dominant infantry weapon until it was replaced by the firearm.  	human

In my department, we tend to use referendums as a shorthand for political all attempts distance Scotland from England and that bled out here, I'm afraid.  I certainly did not mean to infer that the Union of the Crowns (completely blanked on that date!) united Scotland and England politically, only that technically they were now united under one monarch which was more or less the beginning of the process of unification.

987	Yes it’s true, you’re are conflating society with nation. Society can be anything from your village, to your tribe, or lord ship. From a duchy to all of Europe.   As well you are assuming that full mobilization means the same extreme standards of today. England during the early Hundred year’s wars under Edward III fully mobilized for war but that only meant he had 12000 men, out of a country of 5 million. That’s not full mobilization to our standards but that’s what the economic and social system allowed for at the time. 	human

989	The Italian Army in World War II (except for maybe the Alpine Corps that fought on the Russian Front), was relatively inexperienced, had antiquated weapons, had pompous and grandiose but otherwise incompetent officers – and at times were placed in exposed and harsh areas on the flanks of stronger German units. In the case of Operation Compass you need to put yourself in the mindset of the regular Italian soldier. You were most likely conscripted in to the Army. You are a lover, not a fighter. Usually living a simple life. And now you are sent to guard some outpost in the middle of nowhere in the hot tropical sun of the Western Desert.  Your officers, particularly Company grade and higher up, are living luxurious lifestyles. They have the finest wines, and decent food, and are usually placed in houses, or at least decently ventilated command posts. Yet you are basically stuck in tents, or trenches in the middle of the desert. Your rations are meager, and you have to get your water from wells.  You just don’t want to be there. Sure the British, and Commonwealth soldiers do not want to be in the middle of this wasteland either – but at least they have competent officers who lead by example. The British Commonwealth also has better equipment, and better tanks. Sure you may have numerical advantage in some areas, and have tanketts, but otherwise, are outgunned… but most of all your morale is utterly low. Most Italian soldiers, unlike say the Germans, were not as well trained, not as disciplined, and most probably had 0 interest in being at war. It also did not help that their Officer Class acted more like the Officer Class of the 1800s, than a more modern one. The officers kept their distance, and rarely built any relationships with their soldiers. The Italian soldier did his duty, but on extremely rare cases would he go above and beyond his duty, and usually at the first chance to surrender and get out of the war, he would take it. 	human
990	It's not so much control vs liberty, but just a different model of control. If anything, Christian bureaucracy actually afforded a *greater* deal of autonomy to provincial areas, although this did depend greatly on the region and ruler.  Our most apt case-study is pre- and post-conversion England, although there's not a great deal of cultural or religious difference between the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse so the comparisson is still valid. Pre-conversion Iceland is also useful. Pre-conversion, in a largely illiterate society without the bureaucratic structures of government, territory is limited largely to the area which can be directly controlled through the immediate presence of a king or warlord and his retinue. Networks of loyalty are intimate and personal, often reinforced through feasting and gift-giving, and taxation is often collected directly.  Bureaucracy allows this control to be decentralised. Kings can administer far-flung territories through written decrees. Gifts and feasting and the physical presence of the ruler can be replaced by land grants conferred by written charters with a written obligation of taxation or service. Taxation can replace the need to provide physical service, or taxes can be paid in kind or currency. Kings no longer need to directly oversee the implementation of laws, collection of taxes or the delivery of justice, instead leaving provincial elites to oversee these civic duties themselves, as long as they follow broadly the royal laws.	human
991	"This is not at all annoying or needling. I think you're right on the money, at least for certain Classicists (especially older ones and Americans). I could speculate that it's because their interest in the Classics was awakened by the narrative they were fed in school about how the Greeks were the ancestors of ""our"" civilization, and that it's generally encouraged by a tendency of both pop history and academic study to prioritise Greeks and Romans over all the others, reinforcing the notion that these peoples are special. But I really don't know why some people go so far into Hellenophilia. VDH is a special case (and I really appreciate the notion of a semi-annual hate-read); his blinkered political extremism has a more and more tenuous link to actual ancient history. He does not write about Greeks, but rather uses Greeks as a tool to write about modern times, to the detriment of both.  Thankfully, even in the traditional bastion of white male elitism that is Classics, change is occurring. Younger generations of scholars tend to be far less wide-eyed about their subject, far more open to criticism and contextualisation, and generally less invested in narratives about ""western civilization"" and its supposed superiority. It'll take some decades to absolve the field of its sins, but aspects like the current debate on ancient colonization show that there is a way forward."	human

994	So maybe that explains why those countries who had those close structures of power nowadays are better societies comparing to, say, southern European countries. The communities were small and united and they had a local ruler who was aware of everyone's problem as opposed to a king closed in a castle and completely unaware of each region problems, and also, because there's a higher degree of distance between the ruler and the people it's easier to make decisions that oppress the people, because if you are not close to them, it's easier to dehumanize them. If you are a ruler and everyone knows you and you know everyone it's much harder to be able to steal from people, raise taxes to high levels and live magnanimously while your subjects are starving... You'd probably be ashamed to do it or your subjects would easily revolt and overthrow you. 	human

He says that one factor that lead to the switch in Italy is the terrain.  The phalanx relied on tight formations where as a sword and shield allowed for more individual actions.  The terrain in Italy was rough and would often interrupt a phalanx line, giving an advantage to sword and shield fighting.	human

1024	“Submit a great link.”    “Write a great comment.”    I’ll get right on that.	human
1025	I use Tor and a VPN and absolutely no session saving after I close my browser. Sometimes I have a few minutes of downtime at work (code is compiling or I'm waiting for a review) and I want to jump on Reddit for those few minutes.  Lo and behold, I just got the login-wall and was immediately frustrated.  Please, for the love of all that is good, don't do this.	human
1026	It only takes a pretty simple userscript to force legacy pages instead of the new crap.	human
1027	I literally just made a userscript to do this for me and now this is an option? *sigh*	human
1028	Firefox makes a pretty good browser for Android and I believe there is something called always on pc for ios that can enable extensions.	human
1029	Couldn't they just give everyone a little bar across the top with a toggle switch (that can't be overwritten via CSS)? If they wanted to, they could even just put it next to your username and make it a reportable offense to cover/remove it.  Unless you mean like... *in* the code.	human
1030	rollsafe.jpg  Can't move to a different site to get away if all the sites are doing it.	human
1031	Yeah, using things like selectors to add text and such, you could say, doxx someone that only shows up as a hover, or have every line add something harrassing, or something like that.  It's easier to manage with the low ratio of users to subreddits, but every user having it, becomes a moderation nightmare.  I could see some inbuilt themes for profiles but no user css.	human
1032	As somebody who has worked in the same field, I think that's rather unlikely. This sort of thing would take some time to build especially on a large website like reddit. It's probable that this was in the works before the spez AMA.	human

1036	The current process is to redirect the user to the legacy overview if they navigate to a profile page and select this option in preferences. This is great if a user manually enters a URL to a user's profile in their address bar. However, I am sure that users navigate to a profile page via a hyperlink in most instances.  I created a userscript when profiles were first introduced that did what you are doing now. I got tired of the page reloading, so I wrote a new userscrip that adds `/overview` to each `/u/` href. You can see that [here](https://github.com/kimpeek/Overview-Redirect).  Please borrow this idea from me and incorporate it into your existing code. I suck at JS, so improvements may be possible.	human

1038	Oh, that's awesome. I just spent a fair bit of time trying to figure out how to fix the new profile mess - first I'd encountered it was today when my profile got changed, and I did some searching on how to fix it, finally found this post. This is awesome. I genuinely didn't see this in the settings when I first had looked.	human
1039	&gt; I don't know how to reach the admins but...   Maybe you should take a second to read and find out? That probably would have saved you the 10 minutes it took to create a shitpost.   As stated, /r/mobileweb and this *has nothing* to do with the Beta program.	human
1040	But the CSS disabling will have a switch or, better, be per profile.  So, profile reported → wiev with CSS. Unreadable or no problematic content → wiev it with CSS.  Or even better: the report tool will add info if the user was wieving the profile with or without CSS.  I'd really love to be able to add CSS to my profile.	human
1041	Can you give a little gif of it in action or is that against the rules?	human
1042	Don't know if you knew but there has always been a legacy overview option near the top of the profiles.	human
1043	It's there, but it took an extra click each time (or a third-party extension like RES, or some URL manipulation). It's good that they added a preference.	human
1044	I assume they'll keep it as long as the legacy overview page exists (which I believe they've said they plan to support for the foreseeable future). I assume that once the actual switchover to the redesigned site (currently in closed alpha) happens, they'll probably stop supporting the legacy profiles as well, but that won't be for a while after they roll out a public beta for it and work out the kinks.	human
1045	Yay! I don't mind the new profiles too much as a regular user, but as a mod it's harder to tell what's removed or not, etc.	human
1046	Thanks for adding it. The new profiles are a mess of nice ideas that aren't thought out yet but still released for some odd reason.  It seems fairly good for the likes of Gallowboob who post a whole lot more than they comment, but it's just awkward and weird and useless for us commenting people.	human
1047	I got this idea because I read something about how the new profile is supposed to replace subreddits about single persons - but I might have misunderstood this, as english isn't my native language. In this case, being able to customize your own profile the same way as any subreddit would be pretty comfortable (especially by e.g. removing the downvote arrows from your own profile, which could help in stopping people from clicking your username and just downvote everything, just because they disliked one of your comments), but I can certainly see why it is not being implemented.  (In case that there's already a downvote-spamming-protection in place, please ignore the part about the downvote arrows.) 	human
1048	Sweet! I don't hate new profiles, but a lot of people will be happy about this.	human
1049	&gt;I'm sad  [Here's a picture/gif of a cat,](http://random.cat/i/WzNoP.jpg) hopefully it'll cheer you up :). ___  I am a bot. use !unsubscribetosadcat for me to ignore you.	human
1050	I checked the option because although I didn't mind the new profiles as much as other users I missed the simplicity of the older design. As SavvySillybug put it:  &gt;The new profiles are a mess of nice ideas that aren't thought out yet but still released for some odd reason.	human

1053	The main reason most people I know want to use the legacy overview is that the new profile is absolutely useless if you're a moderator trying to look at an account for removed posts/comments.  It's so much quicker to use the legacy one than to fight with the new one.  I don't have an issue with profile self posts or the cosmetic changes, I have an issue with it being harder to find information at a glance.	human
1054	&gt;The new profiles are a mess of nice ideas that aren't thought out yet but still released for some odd reason.  /r/GTBAE	human
1055	"To remove it, you can add a custom snippet that applies only to the front page:      .tabmenu &gt; li:nth-child(1) &gt; a:nth-child(1) {display:none !important}  **[snippets](#res:settings/stylesheet/snippets)** -- [](#gear) [RES settings console](#res:settings) &gt; Appearance &gt; [Stylesheet Loader](#res:settings/stylesheet ""stylesheet"") &gt; [snippets](#res:settings/stylesheet/snippets)  Then you'll probably want to use an extension like Redirector to redirect urls from `www.reddit.com` --&gt; `www.reddit.com/hot`  I think that's the closest you'll be able to get at this point.  "	human
1056	A lot users and moderators depend on the legacy overview page for their day to day operations. We plan on keeping this option around for a long while after even after new profiles are rolled-out.	human
1057	"The ""press embargo"" is lifting a bit after u/amg137's [public blog post](/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/), so it's _okay_ to talk about the redesign in here. (I'll add it to the wiki.)  That said, r/redesign is still a better place to post since it's more focused on the redesign."	human
1058	The new profile page is complete and utter fucking shit. The text is too small, too light **AND YOU FUCKING BROKE CTRL+CLICK**.  that's a god damn mortal sin, it's amazing that people still manage to do this in 2018. for fuck's sake.	human
1059	"Sure, compared to usual technical standards of reddit it is utter garbage (for example, it looks dynamic, so I guess it relies on some homebrew javascript to even display content, not only for updates? And lots of useless clicks is required to get to everything meaningful. What a joke).  But compared to average website in the outer web it's kind of ""normal"". I wasn't even surprised. Trust me I've seen some shit. Moreover, I like the idea of customized profiles which could behave like full-fledged subreddits. Implementation seems to be painfully horrible though."	human
1060	This would be great. For awhile now I've had a constant 7 notifications from ones that I've already read.	human
1061	"Avatar and Header can't be uploaded for me either. Just getting ""something went wrong"". Tried a bunch of things as well.  Are you guys ever going to fix this?"	human
1062	&gt; In case that there's already a downvote-spamming-protection in place  There is.  The problem with reddit making profiles into their own subreddit is that they still need to be usable just as profiles. Anything beyond interface color changes or customizable banners/bios would detract from that.	human
1063	"Check your preferences: there's now a ""View user profiles on desktop using legacy mode"" option"	human
1064	&gt; I realize this would lose the history, but for some people this is not an issue.  On the other hand, the fact that we can't get rid of old chats (or at least hide them and mimic a deletion) is the reason we won't use the feature.  This goes for sent messages too.    Scenario:   You used to be single and would chat or PM with potential dates.   Now you're in a relationship and want to part ways with that history.   Your only course of action at this point is to create a new account.   Now you're a newbie and can't participate in certain subs until your account is old enough and you gain enough karma.	human
1065	Tfw you regret to have a chat with that 18 year old cosplayer girl and afraid that your wife will find out.	human
1066	A temporary workaround in case you need to delete a thread, click the three dots in the upper right of the conversation and block the user. You can then go to your [blocked page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/blocked/) and unblock them, this effectively deletes the chat history.	human
1067	u/reddit_chat_feedback, please provide a way to specifically disable the notification of chat invites in the top right corner.  Reddit is mostly useful because the voting mechanism helps bring quality content to light, and chronological ordering in chat breaks this completely. I'm not interested.	human
1068	Oh, hah  I thought this was another profile post  I forgot how I disabled chat.  It still comes back form time to time, but hitting the X makes it go away for a while.	human
1069	I saw a popup talking about that yesterday when I first booted, but it faded away before I could read it.  I spent about 10 minutes looking in RES for the checkbox.  Never in a million years did I think that would be a reddit setting.	human
1070	Yep, and it seems to hide it from the desktop app as well, but I dont see a way to do the same on desktop.  	human
1071	You are right, I dont see it there either.  Hiding it on the app seems to hide it on the website too though, so thats at least a workaround I suppose.	human
1072	/r/ideasfortheadmins/ *feels* dead, with almost no user activity and almost no *visible* admin activity.  The top post of the last month has 39 points, 36 comments, and is even a sticky. Meanwhile, the top post on /r/beta from the last *24 hours* has over 100 points, and of the last week has over 500 points and over 100 comments. Even if a post to /r/ideasfortheadmins was guaranteed four times as likely to be seen by at least one admin, the user activity level does not make it seem like it. Also, profiles are still being rolled out, so a suggestion relating to them not as out-of-place here.	human

1075	How would a person's profile posts surface then?	human
1076	They should re or cross post them in a real subreddit.	human
1077	Because they’ve stopped relying on users to find the servers. They’d be telling a lie at this point if they continued to say a donation created served time, the ads have gone through the roof around here. 	human
1078	I thought the web view was a chrome feature?	human
1079	I agree. They should at least display some popup when hovering the gold trophy to denote how much you've been gifted. Other users have voiced similar concerns over at /r/ideasforhteadmins.  I'm more concerned about how wide your browser window appears in the screencap (old profile). 4K? Why would you have your browser window maximised at that width? Are there any websites that actually benefit from having it that width?  I only have a 2560x1440p monitor and even then I keep the browser window to ~1700px wide to leave room for other windows. Much more than that seems a waste. Most website content seems to top out at (at most) ~1500px.	human
1080	My ask here is how the money Redditors have spent over the last decade to help Reddit get to the point it is today is now worth less than some blank space. You don’t remove supporter flair once you no longer rely on supporters, in any community I can think of. You keep it as a tribute and the companies should want it to remain as a token of their appreciation.	human
1081	Gilding level VII! That isn't easy to achieve! I agree that how much gold we have been given and have gifted should stay a part of profiles. 	human

1083	I'm just here to give a shout out to epiris	human
1084	"I have it maximized to emphasize (ok, exaggerate a bit) how much empty space there is on reddit, I run Linux with a tiled window manager so rest assured I don't browse regularly like this. I have a second monitor of the same resolution that I snap windows to the edge of my main monitor at 65% of the screen width.  That said most mobile-first designed responsive layouts handle empty space much better by using [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) like the [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/) toolkit which leverages [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) for layouts. For example now that the profile overview page seems to have individual ""cards"" of comment threads, each card could be a item in the flexbox. Once the screen size passes the current fixed-width break point it could split into two or more columns. I recognize I'm not a front end guy though so I'm not qualified to criticize too much here, but I am the *U* in *UI* so I'm definitely going to continue criticism from that angle."	human
1085	I can’t remember the last time I saw a racist or homophobic comment on reddit. What subs are you going to that has them?	human
1086	"That's bloody precious, coming from a guy who goes around calling people [""retards""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7oukxe/for_future_generations/dskdls7/?context=3) and [""autists.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/yesyesyesyesno/comments/7utt0u/why_jesus/dtnw495/?context=3)"	human
1087	You seem to think there’s a correlation between calling someone a retard and racism and homophobia.  Also, you seem to have taken my autist comment out of context.  So I’ll ask you again, retard, what subs are you going to have racism and homophobia?	human
1088	I set up a two-column layout at /r/csshelp for &gt;1880px a long time ago before flexbox had decent coverage. It takes very little effort/CSS to accomplish.	human
1089	Unsure if this is a SQL query bug. Might be something as simple as refreshing the subs based on whether a  user redirects to another account. Wouldn't hazard a guess on what exactly is causing the problem because I don't know the code base.	human
1090	Hey, off topic but do you know of any good resources for learning about media queries/responsive css? I'm a Frontend dev but lack in my css skills since I get handed stylesheets from someone else and just write the js/html.   I read the mdn page but I was looking for something more interactive. If you don't have anything all good, just worth a shot I figured. 	human
1091	"If you were aiming to participate in civil discussion you wouldn't discard all context to create a narrative where you could enter conflict. Let me be reasonable for you, the op said:  &gt; Is that true? I find it odd, because discussions have become increasingly toxic on Reddit overall. &gt; I guess advertisers are going after the fastest growing user segment - the ""racist homophobic frat boy"" community.  The first sentence contains the actual position the op has taken, that is: *discussions have become increasingly toxic on Reddit overall*. The next sentence is written partially in jest, with the OP choosing to use 4 quoted words with negative connotations to highlight the user segments they find *most toxic*. You then ask:  &gt; I can’t remember the last time I saw a racist or homophobic comment on reddit. What subs are you going to that has them?  The OP is skeptical that you have not seen such comments, either directly or the aftermath in the form of [deleted]. So they clicked your post history to get additional context about your motives. They discover the post history of another angry, hateful trump supporter making you the proverbial toxic redditor they were referring to in the *very first* sentence of their comment. They see this person with nothing but toxic post history, full of confrontations and personal attacks for things as petty as people having a different opinion than you- and we never even clicked the ""next"" button. At this point perhaps they find a beautiful irony in the fact someone so hostile to others for such petty differences can't fathom someone else on reddit selecting sexual preference or race as that petty difference. They reply reflecting this sentiment which leads you into:  &gt; You seem to think there’s a correlation between calling someone a retard and racism and homophobia.  Here you completely ignore the fact that you're responses are proving his only premise (that reddit is growing increasingly toxic) for something you feel you justify entering a debate with them. A desire ultimately driven by your hopes of escalation so you may lash out and attempt to hurt them as a short term self medication for your unhappiness.  &gt; And I stand by my statement that I think only an autist would find howtobasic videos funny.  You need to recognize that if someone else finding joy and laughter in something makes you angry enough to personally attack them that there is something deeply wrong with your emotional state. You need to find out what is making you hurt and try to attack that issue directly rather than attacking others.  &gt; So I’ll ask you again, retard, what subs are you going to that have racism and homophobia?  It's so unfortunate to see you talking to other people like this to begin with, but do you think that since you draw the line at peoples intelligence that everyone else must as meaning racism on reddit must be non-existent?  Before you answer consider:   - A mentally challenged person did not choose their mental capacity, nor is there anything wrong with such a person.  - A &lt;enterrace&gt; person did not choose their race, nor is there anything wrong with such a person.  They are both the same hateful statements, you will live a happier life if you stop talking to people like this. Good luck to ya man, hope you feel better."	human

You could have said anything else, but you chose a completely deplorable sexual remark. So I pointed out the fact you are trying to defend the possibility of someone using sexual preference as an instrument for harassment... while using a sexual act as an instrument for harassment.

I only quoted you and wrote a single sentence in question form. Yet you still managed to justify your behavior by creating your own alternate reality- right here before our eyes. A reality where everyone is weak minded but you, so you can rationalize why people are disagreeing with your behavior. I know it’s little interactions like this that help correct your demonstrably unacceptable behavior over time. So I replied to do my part in the correction of a dysfunctional member of society.   There is no hidden agenda, there is no twisting of words or an alternate reality of weak minded sheep trying to give me oral sex. There is only an asshole. Here’s to hoping you put it away one day to show everyone the better side for a while. Take it easy man.	human
1117	&gt; If it gets your motor running, sure. You won. Now give me your address so.I can come over and you can shove me into that locker.   This is you talking shit, and this is you looking for a fight.	human
1118	That was me being sarcastic. I don't feel like I should have to '/s' every time I'm being facetious. But if you want to prove how much of a badass trucker dude you are, I humoured you. I don't really care either which way.  You're the one who feels like there's something to prove. I don't need to fight internet people to give myself value. At the end of the day, you're nothing more than some Redditor who spouts off whatever suits his fancy. I honestly am not so upset that I'm gonna fight you. Feel free to go to the place I PM'd you. But seriously. Don't expect a fight.	human
1119	His comment history is really.... sad. He puts a lot of effort into these little reddit spats, and it really seems like (without a home, with what sounds like a crappy relationship with his family, and seemingly no friends) he's literally just has this and video games. 	human
1120	You’re such a big pussy that all I read is  &gt;queef	human
1121	I mean. He's calling me a pussy because I won't meet him at the Walmart I DM'd him and throw fists.  I'm not taking him anywhere near as seriously as he thinks.	human
1122	"&gt; Now we see why you’re here. Because you were that cringy kid that nobody liked and girls thought were gross. You had your poor little feelings hurt by the cool kids who made fun of you and called you names. So you come to the internet and find some alpha to talk shit to, protected by anonymity and unable to get your face shoved in a toilet.  Lol projecting much? Because you're doing everything you just said, and literally nobody else is, sooooo....  Protip: adults grow up and learn to have class, and are aware that some words are hurtful, regardless of if they're adult or not. Children use words like that because they're dumb and don't know better.  PS: the online trolling usage of ""autist"" and people who actually have autism are very different, and if you were grown past the age of 13 you would know that. "	human
1123	ur a [morbidly](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8qhpr-VYAE6dyq.jpg) [obese](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmjBeN_XEAAGDkl.jpg:large) [waddling](https://youtu.be/XZLDfVW6pLQ?t=15) truck driver miserable with his life. everyone knows you are an emotional and financial burden to society and will be until you die in your mid 40s of heartdisease bitter and alone.	human
1124	And you haven't realized the reality that nobody gives a shit about you, some anonymous douche bag on the internet. Nobody here thinks you're cool, nobody here *actually* think's you're badass. You want to fight someone because they told you to stop calling people retarded? That's really weird, and pretty lame, dude. Also makes you an asshole, like c'mon.   We're not mad, we're just disappointed that you act like a dumb child.	human
1125	Already had one dipshit just like you suggest we meet irl and fight who backed down when he found out that I was not only willing but have done it twice before. So there goes your “I’m rubber and you’re glue” gradeschool comeback.  You grew up to be a grown child, worrying about what you say like a little bitch. I grew into a man. You don’t know the meaning of being an adult.  And if you think autist isn’t a common descriptive term for someone who has autism you’re an even bigger retard than I thought.   You’re so fucking stupid you don’t even know you’re stupid, and that’s the stupidest kind of stupid, stupid.	human
1126	&gt;I’m a cringy coward that jacks off to the thought of talking shit to someone that would cave my face in if I said it in person. I love being anonymous because I’m a loose pussy. Queef.	human
1127	"&gt; So there goes your “I’m rubber and you’re glue” gradeschool comeback.  Except nobody said anything like that lol, but ok.   &gt; You grew up to be a grown child, worrying about what you say like a little bitch.  No, I grew up to be a nice, good person, who has empathy and understanding, and knows how to make and keep relationships. You grew up to be an asshole, who thinks that ""saying it like it is"" is a valid excuse for being a dick  &gt; You don’t know the meaning of being an adult.  Which is richly ironic, coming from you. No wonder you're alone, begging random internet strangers to fight you.  &gt; isn't a common descriptive term  No shit it is, but teenagers like you like to use it to describe people who are acting dumb, when in reality it has nothing to do with intelligence, and in fact, they (people with actual, severe autism) can be smarter than all of us.  &gt; You’re so fucking stupid you don’t even know you’re stupid, and that’s the stupidest kind of stupid, stupid.  Oh, says the pot to the kettle. You don't even *realize* the stupidity of this comment coming from you, and it's hilarious but also very sad. I feel sorry for you, you sad little boy."	human
1128	Yeah, because triggered snowflakes like you are a pretty good laugh. It's some good entertainment tbh. Watching small children try to puff out their chests and act all tough is really funny. You'll understand when you grow up, hun.	human
1129	I really do think when people are lashing out like that they are deeply unhappy with themselves or their lives at the time. It's a way to act out that they can always mentally frame themselves as victorious in. If no one replies, whatever, they didn't care anyway and are already on the next thing. Replies? Good or bad they can always wiggle it around to act as if they are on top and in control despite any evidence or reaction to the opposite. Up/Downvotes are just more affirmation as well.   There is no winning or losing with someone in that sort of place, it's just them kind of publicly losing in a marginally attention getting manner.	human
1130	i think this should also be a thing only for betas	human
1131	"I also have a problem removing ability to view how much we've supported.   If it's a problem with the server time to gilds translation, then just  re-worded it to ""You've gilded 42 users."" or ""You were gilded 32 times""   Honestly, I think it's kind of cool that I've given out 84 gildings and I still don't  have reddit gold.  "	human
1132	&gt;Lol projecting much? Because you're doing everything you just said, and literally nobody else is, sooooo....  &gt;Yeah, you're actions are extremely cringey, it's pretty sad to watch.   &gt;Yeah, someone *should* post your comments from here in there! That'd make a good post.   Aka  &gt;I’m rubber and you’re glue  And  &gt;I know you are but what am I?  You have the mentality of a 10 year old. You’re boring as shit. You repeat yourself. You’re dumb as rocks. Bye, retard.	human
1133	"&gt;	Aka   &gt;	&gt; I'm rubber and you're glue   Proof that you're still a child, because adults know that that's called projecting.   &gt;	You have the mentality of a 10 year old   Says the guy who keeps using insults and comebacks that a 10 year old would use, but ok 🙄😂   &gt;	You repeat yourself   Says the guy who keeps repeating ""/r/Cringe"" everywhere when he has no other good comebacks lol. "	human
1134	And now I’m going to repeat myself every time you reply to me to prove how dumb you are to continue talking to a wall.  Bye, retard.	human
1135	"So first *I'm* dumb because I repeat myself, but then *you* repeat yourself, and it's not dumb? Either repeating yourself *is* dumb or it *isn't*, it can't be both, ya gotta pick one.   &gt;	continue talking to a wall   Oh the irony, and you're too dumb to understand it. It's a shame, really. "	human
1136	OP might have used a 3rd party app	human
1137	Okay? Even if a reddit change affected HoverZoom, that is not reddit's problem, and it's certainly not about a current beta feature of reddit. Again: if you want to report a problem with a third-party extension, contact the developers of that extension.	human
1138	The other day I was getting the same error when not logged in on a clean install of chrome when I tried to load the top posts of any subreddit (and on the front page) except for the last 24 hours.	human
1139	I really hope there is a Night Mode. There should be a law passed where very website must have Night Mode or else be shut down lol.	human
1140	Pretty sure there’s a night mode on the mobile app, not sure if that’s what you mean tho.	human
1141	Personally sensitive to white/brighter colours especially on a screen, dark mode really helps to be able to view longer	human
1142	Hmm... 🤔🤔   \ &gt; says that repeating yourself makes you a retard  \ &gt; keeps repeating himself   MFW 🤔	human
1143	I'll speak for myself but I assume many of us night moders suffer the same. My lights are usually dimmed, especially when I'm relaxing and/or browsing the web/consuming media.  The sudden flash of white adds a great strain on the eye. Reddit being reddit, where one can browse for long time, that strain turns into a headache.  I ended up using Stylus addon on Firefox to customize the themes of the websites I frequently visit. Now the addon is almost of no use because Reddit is the only one left without a native dark mode, on desktop.  I cannot wait for it to happen, especially on classical view.	human
1144	We're still sorting out some of the details, but we see night mode working on conjunction with customized subreddits. We want the hard work communities put into their themes to show through while having a good reading experience for users that prefer having the lights down.	human
1145	Do not launch the redesign without a night mode. It's bad enough that RES won't work anymore but if there's no nightmode I'll stop browsing on desktop period.	human
1146	Please, consider a dark theme. Light themes hurt more the eyes, especially on night.	human
1147	I see a problem where a *lot* of people aren't going to be picking color schemes that work well in both modes, though. I kinda know what I'm doing and I still struggle with colors working well on both light and dark.	human
1148	Ah shit.  I asked a few days ago and they said they 'didn't have a timeline'.  I didn't realize that meant 'never'.  I went a long time without RES... But now I don't want to lose the useful features it provides.	human
1149	It might be possible to use a tool that automatically picks complementary colors for the dark theme that are closest to the light theme colors. There are quite a few of these automatic color palette generating tools it there, this one looks [relevant](http://colormind.io)	human
1150	This subreddit is for discussing the [current desktop beta features](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/wiki/current_features). Feature suggestions belong in /r/ideasfortheadmins.  (And having a window that just disappears on its own after a few seconds would be terrible design.)	human
1151	&gt; I didn't realize that meant 'never'.  That's because it doesn't (necessarily). It just means they don't know when they'll be able to support the redesign, because it's a totally different tech stack.	human
1152	The admins will give access to all mods in a few weeks, and all users in general some time after that. It'll be on a separate domain for the moment so it won't be the default just yet.	human
1153	Please do! It makes it so much easier to moderate when there is a simple overview.	human
1154	One thing that hurts my eyes is the contrast between fonts. It used to be a darker grey, now it's lighter and harder to read. :/	human
1155	Currently /r/Portal is able to [transform itself when RES nightmode is used,](https://i.imgur.com/wW3o0Dz.jpg) drawing from a different set of graphics and CSS styles.  Will this be possible with native Reddit nightmode?	human
1156	I'm assuming a concatenated list of style classes will allow CSS designers the ability to select elements with or without dark mode ensbled. For instance, `.dark` may be a class reddit's front-end applies to the `body` element when the dark mode is on for a user. So, designers/sub-stylers can actively select and style elements with the proper colors.	human
1157	Try inverting colors, I don’t know if this is a thing on desktop but it could help	human
1158	Once I (hopefully) get access to the redesign, I could probably make a dark userstyle for it. 	human
1159	Why not use the default avatars as a ranking system? Age or karma levels changes your snoo  This is how I thought the different snoo expressions changed at first, until I realized it was just a random avatar.	human
1160	Reddit works because of a decent balance of anonymity and general snappiness in loading.  Traditional forums that use avatars (and signatures) destroy that anonymity because pictures are a lot more easily recognizable than names.  Typically, I don't, and probably many users don't, read people's usernames. We just read the post content. Avatars on every post would change that and we'd slowly recognize the power users which centralizes the karma whoring and shifts the dynamics in exactly the way people have been complaining about the new user profiles and posting-straight-to-profile.	human
1161	"https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7spgg0/best_is_the_new_hotness/  Best is new, and is intentionally different from hot. Testing it showed that ""users spent more time on Reddit, and they interacted more with the content they saw"" which is what matters to a site as big as reddit, not the minority of users that even notices a difference. Just be glad they listened to complaints enough to keep hot as an option at all.  Also this has nothing to do with the beta program."	human
1162	Hmm, well I at least can easily agree with the snappy loading.  That would be a nightmare on a big thread now that I'm thinking about it.  Would be better if they're cached on Reddit but still a shit load of download.  Wouldn't be so bad if they just let you turn it off though.  But I guess I kind of understand what you're saying about power users but I DO think people remember names fairly well, though you're right we don't focus on them much (like when you start reading a Vargas post and you're like what the fuck is...oh).	human
1163	Agreed. Im going to log in anyway, and I've been doing the same log in routine for years. There's zero value in this popup asking me if I want to log in. I'd like for a way to turn this off, please.	human
1164	I ment the site-wide redesign, but alright. Any idea if subreddit mods could have a higher chance of participating?	human
1165	They plan to give all moderators access in a few weeks.	human
1166	Quora has a serious problem with celebrity like users. Tonnes of good content is missed because it was posted by a non-famous account.	human
1167	Why not simply have it show up when you hover over someone's name? A box already pops up with user info.	human
1168	/u/vargas is a comedian on reddit if there ever was one. Look at his comments.	human
1169	"/u/_vargas_ is one of the original story shitposters. You know /u/shittymorph and the announcer's table? Think long-form stories that always had a different ending, started out relevant and left you thinking ""WTF did I just read"". That is vargas."	human
1170	You wouldn't be instantly recognized with a default avatar, and that's more an issue with having profiles.	human
1171	Do you get a prize if you're 3 lines in, and realize it's them?	human
1172	You get Reddit silver from me to you. I used to be able to identify a vargas story by the first few lines but it's been a few years. They're pretty much always good, though.	human
1173	Uploading custom avatars is already a feature?	human
1174	Why not both? I like Reddit because I can choose my level of anonymity. My main account my is _me_, if I post a link to my Web site or YouTube channel, I do it knowing that it links the two narratives together. So I’m careful about what I post and what I say with my main account. But I also see it as part of my identity. I don’t have a linkedin account, online me represents real me. Just like in real life.  My burner accounts are for when I need anonymity, or when I need to tell an angsty doxing-prone child to go fuck his hat :)  Future predictor hat on: Reddit will eventually be forced to do away with anonymity. Incidents will lead to law suits, etc.  “After a series of incidents blah blah blah all new accounts must be verified by SMS blah blah”...   “the positive feedback from new account SMS registration process has encouraged us to resource verification for all existing accounts”...  ”send a self addressed stamped envelope containing a hair sample,, a family tree going back 4 generations and a sentimental childhood memento to Reddit Trust Assurance, P.O. box 451”...	human
1175	"Wow, you're *still* allowing me to have control over you. For someone who claims to be a ""real man,"" you sure aren't acting like one. You know what a real man would do? Prove that he is the bigger man and has the higher ground, and that the other person doesn't have control over him, by stopping responding. Guess you're not a real man. "	human
1176	Yes, there are a select few power users.  But the problem is going to exacerbate wiħ avatars.	human
1177	"I know...I like the r/friends function but you can only add/remove them from the web version and not mobile.  Mobile lets you follow and unfollow which is why having a ""Following"" function that pulls only the u/ list that you're following would be great..."	human
1178	Aww, such a sad, little boy. Too bad you're not a real man, or else you'd tell me off and then go away, and stop coming back for more. 	human
1179	Who the fuck do you follow? It's not Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Go there if you want to follow a person. This is for subreddits, not fucking 'following le celebXD'	human
1180	Are you on the desktop site? Because this sounds like a common issue with the app that doesn't belong in this sub.	human
1181	Probably because he doesn’t even know what the follow feature does.  All it does is ‘subscribe’ you to their posts that they make to their profile, much like subscribing to a subreddit. 	human
1182	And Reddit users have complained about features related to following other users since this isn't facebook or twitter. This is why chat got so much shit in the past. It's interesting that all the criticisms on a small post are getting downvoted immediately and there's a response to my criticism within 10 mins of posting.	human
1183	&gt;It's interesting that all the criticisms on a small post are getting downvoted immediately  That’s a pretty far stretch there. Were you in this thread when the 2 users who were downvoted commented? If not then why would you say they’re being immediately downvoted?  &gt;and there's a response to my criticism within 10 mins of posting.  Not really sure what the point you’re trying to make here is, I just happened to see your comment within 10 minutes of you posting and decided to comment. I would’ve probably replied even if your comment was hours old. 	human
1184	You can follow accounts that do recurring posts, but don't have a routine post schedule (short story writers, people who do post-match analysis, game reviews, etc), so you won't miss them if they don't hit front page of the sub.   Maybe you follow a gonewild girl, but they only post certain photos in certain subs.  Maybe you want to follow multiple shitposting accounts, or multiple art-reply accounts (shittywatercolour, shittymspaint, etc), that post across multiple different subs.	human
1185	Alright, then you can keep following content while these people will follow users.  It's just a suggestion for a feature. I don't see how it would take away from your experience by offering an option.	human
1186	The point is, a lot of people want Reddit to stick to being content driven rather than user driven. We don’t want people to care about _who_ posted it. However certain subs are inherently user driven so there’s that as well	human
1187	 It drives the site in a specific direction. Every change like this has driven the site more and more into a curated digital media site.   Every time people like you defend it with the same tired argument. We care because the change will affect more things. It eventually will kill the site. 	human
1188	But sometimes you like the content a certain user habitually posts.	human
1189	"Okay, here's how things should ideally progress: Your idea makes it through and you get your suggestion solidified within the site. People like us would usually NOT get involved in opposing said suggestion because we usually believe it's ""not going to effect everyone else"" at all. But it's not that way. IF we get an option to opt out of it, then that's okay. But because that's just going to be more work I highly doubtful that would be the case.  Your selfish suggestion will be curated to the masses if the majority suggest the same thing. I call it selfish because you've just reverted to deflecting it in a very immature manner as oppose to, even slightest, considering how it would effect others.  You've also just proven OP's argument.  Furthermore, THIS is the reason we don't want that kind of formula because of people like you just like to push for what YOU want. You don't want to talk. You don't want to converse. You want to rant. You have Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all sorts of other apps and sites that curate to your suggestion. It creates a more toxic environment. A good majority of users on this site don't exist in those other outlets anymore because of the toxic environment. So, take some consideration.  Thanks, ArchangelAlkemy  P.S. You never answered my question."	human
1190	It might work to have the follow feature for media people/ select few in reddit.  A generic follow will make a shittier experience for everyone.	human
1191	&gt; We don’t want people to care about who posted it.  They do, though, and have since before I joined 5 and a half years ago. The only way to have a social media site that *doesn't* have well known users is to not display usernames at all, and even then you can't really stop people from identifying themselves in other ways and building a reputation.	human
1192	"&gt;""User subreddits will kill the site""  The stupidest thing about this argument is that user subreddits have been a thing as long as subreddits."	human
1193	I can’t believe that there are two of you morons that have replied to a brick wall that hasn’t read a word you’ve posted for this long. You’ve been putting in so much effort and all I have to do is paste, it’s hilarious. How pathetic is your life? lol  Bye, retard.	human
1194	"You do know that people have been creating subreddits with the same name as their username for years right?  Having ""official"" user subreddits just ensures that it is legit (ie, not someone that reserved a sub with your username)"	human
1195	No, they haven't. Subreddits were an admin-only creation for a while. User subreddits came about 10 years ago.  End of history lesson.	human
1196	As someone without a Facebook I’m not quite clear on what the similarities are between Reddit and FB.   The little profile blurb just seems like fun way to make yourself a little more engaged on the site- you aren’t required to fill it out or upload a picture. 	human
1197	&gt;I'm infuriated that I can't opt-out  There's a stickied post on the front page of this subreddit with instructions on opting out. Did you even bother reading it?	human
1198	It's a carbon copy of the timeline. You can post by default to your profile (aka timeline) which is an aggregate stream of only your posts. Reddit isn't supposed to be a facebook. 	human
1199	the admins straight up admitted the profiles suck in their state of reddit address.  yet they aren't showing any time of willingness to listen to the users for why they suck.  its going to be a clusterfuck when it goes live site wide.	human
1200	infuriated?  you need a life outside reddit dude.	human
1201	To put it in context, I have the new profile. I just logged in one day about a week ago and got a page telling me I had it. So far, it has made 0 difference. Like none whatsoever. I still don't get what the big deal is.  So could you tell me what all the fuss is with it? I don't get how people are using their profiles and what about the new profile prevents them from doing so?  Like is there a side to reddit I am entirely missing or something?	human
1202	&gt; I would also appreciate some more feedback on what's hurting your eyes on the default theme.  I posted this to this sub last month which explains some of the readability issues.  https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/comments/7r1ljq/feedback_unreadable_lowcontrast_text_on_new/  &gt;Looking at the styling of the page I see a lot of text elements with the color #a5a4a4 on a plain white background. According to this Contrast Checker that results in a contrast ratio of 2.49:1. The minimum contrast ratio recommended by the Web Accessibility Initiative is 7:1.

1203	"&gt;	that hasn’t read a word you’ve posted for this long.  Oh I know you haven't, but that just makes my point even stronger, and makes you look even stupider :)   &gt;	How pathetic is your life?  I mean, I don't think that calling people retards is ok, nor do I actively defend it, so not anywhere near as pathetic as yours.   &gt;	You’ve been putting in so much effort   Why not really, this is probably my longest one, and it took me about ~~30~~ 45 (added 15 for gif finding) secs. It's something to do while I poop.   &gt;	I literally told you I would be repeating myself.  I know, right after you said that repeating yourself makes you a moron! The irony is delicious!

1204	Haha so if I have one unique viewer in a day, it's safe to assume that that viewer is me (as I click on my profile to get to the traffic page)?	human
1205	I honestly have nothing better to do, so we can keep going forever. You think you have control, but you're wrong. As soon as you stop responding, so will I, because there's nothing really tying me to this convo. I just like poking the bear and wasting it's time. I know that every time you see a response from me, you feel like you have to respond back (pro-tip: you don't), and that you waste a few seconds each time replying, and that's a few seconds each time of your life that you'll never get back, and that's what really makes this funny. I honestly couldn't care less, I just like annoying you and wasting your time :)	human

1207	"Yeah I do, but my point still stands.  What is different about a post on \/u/washingtonpoast hitting the home page vs a post  from \/r/washingtonpost hitting the home page?  I honestly don't know self promotion reddit rules too well though (is that why the wapo subreddit was banned?).  Don't get me wrong, I hate self promotion but I just really don't see much of a difference between user subs vs regular subs named after a user.  I *do* think this should be a configurable option.  In fact, I would love it if all wapo garbage was posted solely to the /u/ subreddit, as this makes it extremely easy to filter it all out.  I already have a userstyle rule on my end to hide all /u/ stuff, but I 100% agree this should be configurable in reddit.      div[data-subreddit^=""u_""] {         display: none;     }  "	human
1208	To switch from OP to OP? Why would you have to read all the replies, is it loading them at all that's a problem for you?	human
1209	You have to be invited by the admins. The alt I use to moderate a large subreddit has it, but this account doesn't.	human
1210	Wait, I've seen this sales model before...  Isn't it like $80 for a 10 minute chat on Kik and your underwear in a Ziploc bag shipped to my door is like $150? That's how this works right?	human

1216	Not so far into the future, light text on dark background will be a lot more commonplace. Even YouTube added it. White background is a skeumorphism of paper. With how many users reddit has and how long the users spend here, I'm sure any estimate of total energy saved would be impressive.	human
1217	Alien Blue allowed you to swipe right on a thread to collapse it. Useful for jumping to the next conversation. On desktop, I've gotten used to mouse gestures. I used to think mouse gestures were overkill, but after using Vivaldi, I realize they are easy to learn and super useful. Would love to mouse swipe a thread to collapse it, but I don't think that'll ever happen. Maybe a floating collapse button would work.	human
1218	That seems like a biiiig ask, but also a great idea.	human
1219	I understand that, but Im trying to think about ways to make the profile system not Facebook. Why not make it almost like a online portfolio that you can customize, create an identity (real or fictional) and be proud of.  	human
1220	This is a pretty awesome idea, but overall I think this beta/redesign is mainly intended to simplify the whole Reddit experience rather than complicate. It's a difficult balance to keep the long\-term members here while simultaneously bringing new members. Every major change has the possibility to send both away. This idea seems closer to LinkedIn to me than anti\-Facebook, but I hope the team looks into this.	human

1223	Well, we definitely need a wall or filter for posts made to our profile, because I can't find anything posted on my profile because it lost with all my activity on reddit. 	human
1224	Yeah, so like, when cross-posting to one's profile it becomes a new post, and often it can be the comments in a thread that makes it fun to share.  And then, as you mentioned, having a separate tab for full shares (not x-posts) would make sense. Would love to have an RRS feed of that from people I follow.	human
1225	A crosspost is a repost... not a share of the original post with all original comments. It is NOT called a crosspost which i am suggesting.	human

1244	&gt;As we started talking about in a series of recent r/changelog posts, we’ve been working to make the Reddit home feed more personal by [surfacing posts from communities you’ve shown interest in recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7hkvjn/what_we_think_about_when_we_think_about_ranking/) and by [filtering posts you’ve already seen so there is always fresh content](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7j5w9f/keeping_the_home_feed_fresh/). We started by doing tests that showed that these changes made Reddit better: users spent more time on Reddit, and they interacted more with the content they saw. So we were ready \(and excited!\) to roll them out  Sounds like they did :)	human
1245	That's not a beta feature. Are you sure you're not talking about the /r/toolbox feature?	human

1251	I like that mockup, I think it could even go down to one line for the context -- Title | 1 month ago | Submitter | subreddit. Doesn't need to read like a sentence, in this case I'd much rather skim the key details and get on with reading the comment.   Also, I'd really like to see the first comment made in any given thread, rather than the most recent -- then expand to show the subsequent conversation. Even with the post as context, when you get several replies deep in a thread the discussion may have gone off on a whole different tangent, and it's always better to read a conversation in the order it happened.	human
1252	People moved on from MySpace, Orkut, Digg, and reddit is displaying all the signs that it will follow suit pretty soon too.  People will just move on to a platform that isn't desperately trying to monetize them to the point that it becomes annoying.	human
1253	Not sure if you realise this but you complain... A-fucking-lot (at least in your comment history you do). Not only that but you claim opinions as facts and your facts are often incorrect.  Snapchat is actually gaining users overall, their changes had a small (as in less than 1/2 of 1 percent) percentage of users that said they were leaving, very few did.  The day go issue was less about the look / feel of the site and more about how they fundamentally changed how it operated.  You may not like some of the changes, ok good for you. You are actually in a very small minorit y of Reddit users that don't like it. Quit trying to act like everyone is going to leave because of the changes, they aren't.    I get that you want to feel special and think that starting another thread about the same shit is somehow going to make Reddit go we'll badkarma12 hates the features that we are doing to improve functionality and revenue and with him added that makes .0001% of the userbase. Screw all the market research we did, we gave to scrap it now or he will leave.  If you hate it all that much use tempermonkey an. Hange it to how you want it... But quit acting so fucking whiny and entitled.	human
1254	&gt; You are actually in a very small minorit y of Reddit users that don't like it  I would like to know where you got this information.	human
1255	Well Snapchat changed their interface less than a week ago, so let’s at least give it some time before we conclude “Snapchat changed and they’re still not making money”	human
1256	From a developer standpoint, yes, listening to feedback is awesome, but they don’t have to just settle on features that work fine as is. They are supposed to innovate, create, experiment, etc. so let them do what they want with their app while still giving constructive feedback.	human

1259	While you make some salient points, any comment that starts off with an ad hominem attack comes off to me as juvenile. Sounds like a fed-up Reddit employee tbf.	human

1261	The problem is that reddit is so much bigger and more powerful than other failed curating sites and there are not any real alternatives. They know this very well and they might lose some people, but most will just complain a bunch and deal with it. digg's main issue was that reddit existed for people to flee to. While there are alternatives to reddit, they are not nearly what reddit was when digg imploded. 	human
1262	And this is the natural lifecycle of web-based communities.    bianca.com   Also, Facebook has actually had a decrease in users for the first time ever	human

1269	A	human
1270	First of all it's Digg, not Dig.  Secondly, the redesign of Digg had nothing to do with its downfall. It had to do with powerusers getting more power.  Nothing in the redesign of reddit will change the way things are being run now. It is just getting a much needed make-over.	human
1271	“Digg” autocorrects to “dig” on my phone. Shouldn’t matter, most people know what I’m referring to.  Actually, the redesign did play a part in its extinction.   &gt; Nothing in the redesign of reddit will change the way things are being run now  A broad claim, nonetheless I beg to differ. But as I stated in my original comment, I do not believe Reddits redesign will cause it to lose a majority of its users. Unlikely, but again who knows. That’s what happened with *Digg*	human
1272	oops, forgot to read the entire title... yeah then that's a different thing. With the redesign everything NSFW is blurred out, no matter of source site. tbh I didn't notice so far since most picture usually are hosted on imgur tho	human
1273	I think there's a simple lesson here:    **When designing a replacement for a functional and well-liked product, make sure that your replacement is actually *better* and not just newer / prettier.**    Reddit has done some things that are better.  For example pop-up info cards on user names.  This gives the most frequently wanted info about a user without needing a click and a pageload, saving time.  That's *better*.    Reddit has done some things that are NOT better.  For example, IMHO, the new mobile site- AJAX'd to hell so it acts like an app-within-a-browser with its own thumper, it looks super cool but takes longer to load and in some cases breaks back/forward browser functionality.   In general, one of the best things about Reddit (IMHO) is that it DOESN'T use a bunch of browser scripting, standard HTML type pages load faster and work better (even if they don't look as pretty).   Or for another example- the top of the new profile pages.  You hide the buttons Legacy, Saved, Hidden, etc behind a ... button, even though there's plenty of room for them, and hitting Legacy opens a new window for no apparent reason.  The older design made it easy to access these pages with one fewer click and no new window.  Thus- newer, prettier, but not better.    I've seen the concept drawings for the new site.  My biggest concern is they seem less dense.  The one with big thumbnails could be nice for image-based subreddits, but the others (including the super compact view) seem to use more screen real estate to do the same thing.  	human
1274	I can tell you're a dev because of how wrong this answer is. They are supposed to make money for their investors. They don't have to do anything but that.	human
1275	I'm of the opinion that the thing keeping Reddit alive right now isn't how good it *is*, but how good everything else *isn't*. I feel like it's inevitable at this point that at some point, someone's going to make a website that has what made Reddit good sans the stuff that Reddit's putting in to make it not so good, and people will just migrate to that.	human
1276	"Well, I do get it -- that we (the user base) are simply a commodity and every single thing we enter in free apps / webapps is forever out there and for sale and will never be able to be kept private or secret again, no matter how hard we try to delete it.  The only thing stopping anyone from being completely exposed publicly is the cost/benefit ratio in doing so.  With a tiny bit of effort, pretty much anyone can find out anything they want to about anyone, and then use that information as they see fit.  So what's stopping it from happening right now, to individual people?  Return on investment in doing so, at the individual person level -- but it's happening now at the target demographic level for sure already, thanks to the power of today's computers in crunching data.  Once you agree to the TOS and Privacy Statement of an app or Webapp, it's pretty much game over for anything you put into those apps -- and you just have to hope that they are an ethical entity (and they don't get breached).  So, people that complain about free apps and their ""intrusiveness"",  or other aspects of it they may not like, really just have to deal with it or leave the app.  Maybe ""entitled"" wasn't the best choice of words, but the meaning maybe is now more clear, based on the above."	human
1277	There’s always going to be a chunk of a user base that hates something because of the change, but I don’t think you can say that’s “THE problem.”  That’s a quick way to dismiss any bad reaction to any change. Why did they change to fuchsia text on a lime background, this is terrible! Oh you just don’t like change!  I’m not taking a side on this. I like some of the changes and not others. But to suggest that all the criticisms are just people not liking any change is fallacious. 	human
1278	"You keep saying ""the users"" but I think the kind of user you are thinking of is a minority. Or at least a minority of the screen time. Discerning reddit users' habits are not very lucrative. For one thing, I bet the crossover between people who are very active in the reddit community and people who use adblocking software is pretty large. Reddit Inc prefer a different sort of user, one who casually scrolls through reddit a lot without being too much trouble, who has an account mainly because their favourite content generators might post exclusive content here and FOMO. "	human
1279	Snapchat is a publicly traded company who’s stock has done poorly since the IPO. They have to appease their shareholders even if that means a weak redesign that increase revenues.   Reddit (thank god) is privately held; albeit with a couple investment rounds under their belt, so it’s a bit different. That said, I agree with you. There are a few problems here that could be fixed, but certainly none serious enough to warrant a full redesign. It feels like the redesign is being masked as a solution to current problems instead of to increase revenues. I’d rather have reddit the way it is with a few small problems than a redesigned platform with the problems (possibly) solved.  	human
1280	Well it seems like they're implementing some of the enhancements RES brings (save for customizable shortcut bar, NDA so people can't say if its there and better). Once they bring it over the only thing I can imagine is turning off infinite scrolling and maybe bringing some butting front and center from behind a (...) button. 	human
1281	&amp;gt; #How can I get a trophy? &amp;gt; &amp;gt; The first rule of trophies is **you don't talk about trophies**. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; (Rules 2 to ∞ are simply repetitions of this first one, with increasing levels of emphasis.)  from https://www.reddit.com/wiki/awards  ----  The beta awards were from before opt-in beta existed for the very reason of people joining, not contributing anything, and getting the award.   You can't get it now. 	human
1282	Market research is a load of junk and leads to boring design catering to new users. 	human
1283	If you're here for the trophy then you can wait a very long time because that ain't gonna happen. Beta is supposed to be for helping out testing stuff and noticing bugs and giving feedback. Not get free shit because your lazy ass decided to subscribe here lol	human
1284	I think ~~Dig~~ Digg died because it became increasingly obvious from things like their infamous bury brigades that they weren't just an aggregator, they were a *selective* aggregator that systematically allowed certain user submitted content to be buried.  And to add insult to injury, they were burying a lot of things that needed to be discussed like climate change.   If they wanted to just bury shit posts, fine. But when you have a really popular website that claims to be an open aggregator of content, and you secretly start trying to influence that content in a way that could have an actual societal impact...nah, fuck you and the bits you piped in on. 	human
1285	I feel this way too. Especially when Reddit is so willing to take a hardline on subs like deepfakes and leave us T_D. It is starting to feel like Digg, too politically motivated to be an unbiased or general aggregator. 	human
1286	&gt; I do not believe Reddits redesign will cause it to lose a majority of its users. Unlikely, but again who knows. That’s what happened with Digg  I think the danger, at least from my perspective, is that they seem to be disenfranchising ride-or-die and longtime Redditors. The more casual users will not care, but here's the thing with filthy casuals, they are not **loyal**.   So if you piss off your base and appeal to the casual user, you are setting yourself up to fail when the next Reddit emerges. 	human
1287	Reddit is my new Digg. I eventually came to loathe Digg due to the things I learned Digg was doing, its not about the users or content or redesign overall.    They banned deepfakes before T_D, for fck sake, I support metoo, but its just totally irrational to me, to ban a sub on the basis of sexual exploitation (generally against women) and leave a sub of misogynistic racists untouched.  So yeah, I do not really like it here anymore. Its like that feel where you know you need to find a new job so you sit at your current job and browse for the new job.  I am hoping I find my Reddit replacement from a disgruntled Reddit community also leaving Reddit...which I am sure will be banned for some pseudo reason and T_D will remain, yippee.	human
1288	True. I mean, worse snapchat is better than no snapchat. Well, not really, because there might be a better replacement	human
1289	Why do you say that? Making money for a business's stakeholders is the entire point. I don't like it but it is.	human
1290	You’re welcome!  And no worries, your thanks is reward enough for me.  I hope you have a good rest of your day. 	human
1291	They have posted more user growth now than when Instagram Stories came out, for the first time.   Snapchat doesn't want to force users to watch full ads since that would kill UX, but also want to make money. They need to find a balance to get long-term success.	human
1292	I think you summed it up. Reddit is poorly monetize and they want to change that.  They are going about it arse about face if you ask me.  They should be focusing on audience segmentation and ad serving.  They have at their fingertips a massive amount of users and user data. They could target the ads you see sooooooooo much better than what sub you're on.  If anyone from reddit happens to read this, as an advertiser it's not about the sub the user is on but who the user is and when they are browsing.  Personalisation and contextualisation.  They would have multitudes more ad space to sell and could up ctr considerably all without even needing to take up more ad space on page.	human
1293	A dev wants to do cool shit. Stakeholders care about their return. I fail to see how that's off topic but alright.	human

1320	If someone spams you, you have a block option below each message.  If you want to block a certain user, you can go to his overview (reddit.com/user/&lt;name&gt;/overview/) and click the block option below any of his posts.  It is not possible to block a user by name at the moment. You can use RES to ignore him though.	human

That site was getting really weird towards the end.  I always thought it was neat how Kevin interviewed Trent Reznor though, and all the little podcast stuff they did. The site definitely had a stronger sense of community. 	human

1326	That is a bizarre thing to get so angry about. Are you sending them in a professional context on emails? Create a hyperlinked word just like you would on reddit.  Is it for Facebook?

1340	**Eth**  Eth (, uppercase: Ð, lowercase: ð; also spelled edh or eð) is a letter used in Old English, Middle English, Icelandic, Faroese (in which it is called edd), and Elfdalian. It was also used in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages but was subsequently replaced with dh and later d. It is often transliterated as d (and d- is rarely used as a mnemonic). The lowercase version has been adopted to represent a voiced dental fricative in the International Phonetic Alphabet.  ***  **Thorn (letter)**  Thorn or þorn (Þ, þ) is a letter in the Old English, Gothic, Old Norse and modern Icelandic alphabets, as well as some dialects of Middle English. It was also used in medieval Scandinavia, but was later replaced with the digraph th, except in Iceland, where it survives. The letter originated from the rune ᚦ in the Elder Fuþark and was called thorn in the Anglo-Saxon and thorn or thurs (a category of beings in Germanic paganism) in the Scandinavian rune poems. Its reconstructed Proto-Germanic name is Thurisaz.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/beta/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28	human

[This announcement from 18 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7spgg0/best_is_the_new_hotness/) says it will be coming in a few weeks.  The change is present on one of my reddit accounts but I was hoping there was a way to opt in to it.	human
1355	On my other account every time I upvote a post and refresh the page it disappears. On this one hot and best are identical no matter what I do.  So it is clear to me that some setting is different for the two accounts, which is why I'm asking if there is an opt in.	human

1359	GUYS I HAVE A GREAT IDEA: let’s take the extraordinarily simple core idea that helped us grow despite myriad flaws and do a Facebook wall line thing! 	human
1360	When visiting the Reddit homepage I sometimes get the normal sort (hot, I think) but recently I've been sometimes getting another new sort called 'best' that tends to focus more on the subreddits I actually check since they're small.  It's not a bad sort and I can always turn it off by going to the top of the page and switching, so I don't mind it. Obviously in the long term there needs to be a setting to pick your preference of what sort you want default on your front page.  The only real problem i have is that my mobile app (RiF) doesn't seem to realize this is happening and just gives me whatever random sort the website chose gave to the app.	human
1361	Yeah, RIF doesn't seem to have implemented a difference between hot and best in the feed.	human
1362	Problem: Leaking water tube.  Fix: Replace tube.  Work Around: Fix tube with duct tape. End Around: Remove tube and plug the other end to the neighbor's.   Now that's a ridiculous situation and probably not even really applicable in real life, but that's about the difference between work around and end around. Work around is a clever way to fix a problem while an end around is a way to achieve a fix using less than savory means. 	human
1363	I have RiF and [I can see a Hot &amp; Best sort option on my home page](https://i.imgur.com/ojnD6EN.png), I think you need to update the app?	human
1364	It does seem like I'm seeing a lot of posts based on my interests, including some not particularly popular hobbies of mine, which previously never graced the front page. I'm seeing a lot of stuff that upsets me as well, but it's all related to subjects that I consider to be important, and usually comes from subs that I frequent for that reason.	human
1365	Does your viewing history include a lot of content that might be potentially upsetting, such as posts from people with contrary opinions areas that are of importance to you? If the algorithm is doing this, it might be trying to tie in related content.	human
1366	"It shouldn't be, no. r/all behaves the same as it did previously.  We _have_ added a new sorting option (""best"") to the frontpage options."	human
1367	Filtering saved by subreddit is already a feature of reddit gold.	human
1368	would be nice if there was a bot that reuploaded the v.redd.it videos to streamable or something else.	human
1369	Ah, it's a very useful feature. 	human
1370	It's still a shithole for the most part even after filtering the 100 worst subreddits.	human
1371	it absolutely is, god forbid I click on a link I'm not interested in, the next several pages are filled with garbage I accidentally clicked on.    Also I did not drive a car for 2 years and the week I registered my vehicle all my ad choices and reddit stories switched to family vacations, watches, and nicer cars. 	human
1372	"I'm not asking that they do away with anything.  Quite the opposite.  I'm asking why they ""plan"" on keeping the facility to step around the shit they wasted time on around only for ""a long while""... while what they *should* do is do away with is any ""plan"" to *ever* remove the option to step around the pile of shit they've fucked-up in creating.  Keep the pile of shit right where it is.  Just ""plan"" on keeping the path around it around forever.  Not another fucking thing need be done. Ever. Just as there was no reason to fuck-forth the mess of shit to begin with. Leave the shit alone and leave the path around the stinking shit alone... *forever*."	human
1373	"I think the ""Best"" sorting option takes geography into account.  I'm an American living in London, and since Best became the default, all of the UK-centric threads I subscribe to seem to have a much higher ranking."	human
1374	I have no idea what the difference is between Hot and Best. They're almost identical for me, so as far as I can tell Best is just a slightly different method to get the same results, while Top (Past Hour) is too fresh and hasn't had the garbage posts filtered out yet.	human
1375	/r/all behaves as it did before.   On your front page, Best (the new one) should still show only stuff you're subscribed to. It takes some getting used to because it avoids showing you stuff you've already seen a lot, instead of you having to hide the posts or hide them through voting. You can still click on Hot to use the other sort. 	human
1376	Not everyone wants to install a 3rd party browser extension (which uses a ton of RAM) to get this kind of functionality.	human
1377	"&gt; It shouldn't be, no. r/all behaves the same as it did previously.  Could you clarify this, have the tweaks meant ~~to target the_donald~~ to improve subreddit variety been reverted now that we have ""best"" sort?  It would be really nice if r/all remain sorted in a transparent way, like the old simple hot sort:  https://medium.com/hacking-and-gonzo/how-reddit-ranking-algorithms-work-ef111e33d0d9"	human
1378	r/all sort is no longer sorted in a transparent way.  Reddit used to be open source, and the algorithm for hotness was pretty simple:  https://medium.com/hacking-and-gonzo/how-reddit-ranking-algorithms-work-ef111e33d0d9  But these days something has changed.  If you try to apply this formerly public approach to the results of r/all you get back very different result order.  You can see this at https://snew.github.io it sorts the stories it receives by the old algorithm, but shows the ranking numbers from reddit's new hidden sorting mechanism.	human
1379	"That article actually misses a few important parts of the hot sort that you've probably noticed before (mostly because they aren't in the same part of the codebase and the author didn't know to look for them), for instance sticky posts are excluded from being ""hot"", each post after the first from a particular subreddit is given a progressively higher penalty to prevent ""clumping"", etc  I don't want to go too far into how best works because it's still experimental and exceedingly unlikely to still work the same way in a few days. I don't want people using anything I say as ""this is the truth"" when it was just the *the truth at the time*. We can be more specific about how the production version works once we have a production version, though"	human
1380	"I'm not asking about best though, best isn't applied to r/all as I understand it and hopefully it never will be.  &gt;  for instance sticky posts are excluded from being ""hot""  My understanding is that this wasn't always the case and it's one of the changes I was referring to in my comment:  https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4oedco/lets_all_have_a_town_hall_about_rall/  https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/   r/all used to be a relatively objective/fair measure of what the community was interested in, but people started complaining about seeing things they didn't like.  So a few patches were made to try to ""improve"" what used to be objective/fair in order to satisfy those who didn't like what they saw.  Sometime in this process, reddit opened up the user subreddit blocking feature for r/all which is a real solution to the original problem (I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE!!! ) that doesn't break what r/all was.  Now that reddit allows users to block subreddits they don't like from r/all individually, the tweaks aimed at ""improving"" the listing seem less necessary.  In general I wish reddit would put more focus on allowing end users to control their own experience rather than fostering the expectation that moderators and now admins should curate the site for them."	human
1381	&gt; Wasn't it like MisterBabyMan who posted the bulk of the content, and anybody who posted that content just got downvoted even if they were first?  Yeah exactly. It was almost turning into a sub like /r/me_irl, close community, but so eccentric and filled with inside jokes/trends that it became completely inaccessible for the rest of us. 	human
1382	If you're not logged in, Reddit now presents you with a feed based on what people in your state/province/country are upvoting.	human
1383	I only noticed when I saw a post from /r/Steak at the #1 spot with like 150 upvotes.  Also /best removes stuff once you've seen it once, so it makes it harder to check up on threads later to see how far they've climbed or to look through new comments.	human
1384	Why should I see content I disagree with? There's a reason you can personally block subs from all.	human
1385	"Got a car a few months back. Ever since I got the car, a good chunk of my ads are for cars. Come on, I'm typing everywhere that I don't need a car anymore. Why they still serve me car ads just goes to show ""targeted"" advertising is still in it's infancy. They're only going to get smarter. "	human
1386	Not trying to sound like a dick, but you know they have an NSFW filter right?	human
1387	Damn i didn't expect a response. Thank you. 	human
1388	I don't want a NSFW filter because subs frequently abuse the tag and mark things are such when they aren't. I want to not see porn.	human
1389	Where there is a complaint there is opportunity though. It seems like a hard concept to juggle both perspectives. We don't want to forever hide peoples messages, but we don't want spam to reign. Maybe there would be a way, by using text size and color gradients, to diminish the visibility of negatively voted chat messages?  Still have yet to use this though, so yeah.	human
1390	I just want to have a chatroom to use for each subreddit. I have no use for communicating with people directly. The amount of PM's I get I can keep up with, trust me. Is this something they're working on? Or not part of the plan?	human
1391	I'm pretty sure it's just showing posts from a lot of lower traffic subs that hot wasn't. I'm subscribed to /r/rabbits and probably hadn't seen a post from there in months, but with the best sorting I'm suddenly seeing new ones all the time, even though I had basically never clicked on them before or since. IMO it's a good change.	human
1392	Standard browser behavior is to open a new tab after clicking a link with the wheel.	human
1393	well they stand to gain a large influx of users if they managed to make reddit mainstream and let's face it, we're stuck here no matter how they change the site	human
1394	Click on the alert, and click the deny/block button (I don't remember what it's called). This won't alert the other person in anyway. Then click the x on the corner of the chat window. This makes it go away, and just leaves it in the bar up near your username/mail/prefs/logout.  This is pretty much as out of sight as it gets. Chat will become a mainstay feature of reddit in the near future.	human
1395	Well, you kinda *did* ask for it by being a beta tester...	human
1396	Maybe if we all hate it enough they won’t implement it? Does that become a possibility at all?	human
1397	It's annoying for me as a moderator because people use it to get around modmailing and shit trying to get me to do favors for them. 	human
1398	Wouldn't you have a notification icon regardless whether it be modmail or chat request?	human
1399	Yeah. But people have a mentality that they can bypass modmail and send a chat request instead. There's no record of it on the sub and the other mods don't see it. It's just annoying. People didn't do this as much with PMs. But when the chat went live, I started getting a bunch of request from people trying to get me to bend the rules for them.	human
1400	Well i do agree that unlike the OP your problem with the chat is a genuine one.	human
1401	That’s just pathetic. Rules are in place for a reason and everyone, even mods, must abide by them. It’s stuff like this that really emphasizes the the bad reputation of redditors spread across other platforms—the stereotype of us being a bunch of self-righteous manchildren.	human
1402	Yes, I'm sure it costed millions to implement a simple chat feature OMEGALUL	human
1403	This shitty screen is so shitty.  What are they thinking?? If I wanted to log in I'd bloody well do it, but since I'm harassed to sign in whenever I hit the front page, I'm NOT going to sign in and I just close the browser because I'm so annoyed.  The shitty screen is intrusive and there's no way around it, it completely ruins a non-logged-in user's experience hitting the front page. For fuck's sake, why would you want to ruin a user's first impression of the site?  Pure shit. The sooner they get rid of it the better. This is shitty fucking feature. 	human
1404	He asked to be able to opt out of a feature, not dictate whether it is implemented. That's unreasonable?	human
1405	Because a lot of schools and workplaces might have let people browse reddit, but because there's a chat now, the whole website could be blocked for having chat.   Also, if you have to have your screen zoomed in because disabilities, it actually takes up an annoying chunk of the screen. 	human
1406	"I'd rather not get surprised by seizure causing animated profile pictures because reddit thinks the moronic ""other interesting profiles"" is something I want to see when I accidently click a user name instead of the up or down vote."	human
1407	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1408	The first thing I heard about this feature is when I got spammed via it this morning by a karma shopper.	human
1409	You opted into the Beta, this doesn't mean you just get certain parts of what you want, this means that you are testing new things for Reddit, so they came up with a messenger system, I think it's pretty neat, so if you don't want it, there's an opt out button in your preferences.	human

1411	This is a (common) bug with the mobile app. It has nothing to do with the beta. /r/redditmobile is the place for this, not /r/beta.	human
1412	I know this is a little late, and it's not exactly a 'fix', but there is a stylish for this that is made to be reactive with the new profile pages:  https://userstyles.org/styles/147463/reddit-profiles-reduce-width?utm_campaign=stylish_stylepage	human
1413	I’d normally discount it as anecdotal evidence, but this is my post and it’s gotten a lot of feedback relative to the sub, so it’s damning evidence.  But in all seriousness, it’s always hard to tell when the answer to a question of this nature is evasive. Could a new site-wide tweak be interacting with r/all’s sorting algorithm in a way that might yield a similar result?	human
1414	It’s amazing to me that someone didn’t attempt to take this out of context and recast it as a political thing	human
1415	I wasn't intentionally being evasive, sorry if it came across that way.   It very well could be a side effect of something else, and I'm just not thinking of it. Are you noticing this on a particular platform (eg iOS or desktop web), or across them all?	human
1416	I want to say both iOS and desktop, but I can’t say with certainty (if I’m checking this, it’s usually iOS). It occurs in short bursts, and it might just be confirmation bias, but it’s been happening for a month or so at least. I can’t remember a specific example off the top of my head right now, but usually it just involves clicking a link that’s well outside my interests and suddenly seeing way more posts on the subject over the next 28-48 hours.   You’re not coming off as evasive, by the way. 	human
1417	why is there always a relevant xkcd	human
1418	This guy responded on a dime to demonstrate engagement and concern, and then *poof*.  A novel PR approach.  MIGHT NEED A LITTLE OIL, RUSTY. 	human
1419	no offense man, but turning on the snark just because you don't have a direct reply from an admin in three hours is super disrespectful of my time, especially considering it took *you* 40 hours to respond to my first comment. It's 9:30pm here and I was helping you out because I don't like users being confused.  But even *with* all that, there's nothing to look into, and the answer to your question remains the same. r/all is sorted and behaves exactly as it did last month, and the month before, and the month before that.	human
1420	Sorry didn’t read before replying. Italics, you need  a hug, I’m getting a cigar and a saxophone until I find out the truth.	human
1421	Thank you for linking it to me. I've installed it and it works fantastically, and it's saved me the time of having to do it myself, which I'm glad for. However, this is hardly a fix, and will need changing whenever the code itself is changed. The developers of Reddit should be the one doing this, not users.	human
1422	Because when you make the same comics for a decade you will either make one about everything, or you will stop making comics.	human
1423	They're not interested in any of this feedback.  They're taking a very arrogant approach. They think we're just being closed-minded and that we fear change.   It's tough watching a company digg^® themselves a hole that they might not be able to crawl out of... 	human
1424	Beta reddit is different from this new profile stuff. The beta version is just certain features that aren’t ready for full fledged rollout but users, voluntarily, get to try them. The new profile thing was a part of beta but it’s been fully rolled out and that’s why it’s the default view for all new profiles now. The option to try out beta version of reddit was available long before all of this mess. For instance, I’m a part of beta but my profile still has a legacy view (I think. I use RES to force all profiles to legacy view now but it was definitely legacy when I created this profile)	human
1425	Just over 13,000 subs.  I just logged on one day and found this in my inbox:  &gt; Hello u/[redacted]!  You might have heard that we are working on redesign to make the Reddit experience better for both moderators and users. Reddit has grown to what it is today because of you - moderators. We love how passionate you are about your communities and wanted that to be reflected in the redesign. Because of this, we made styling communities one of our biggest priorities. However, we need your help.   We selected your subreddit at random to be one of the first to have access to style. We would love for you to style your community together with your moderator team. All you have to do is opt into the redesign on the website or visit alpha.reddit.com. However, please keep in mind that this work is not feature complete yet as we are adding more functionality over the coming months.   All styling changes that you are making will only affect the alpha website. As of today, about 1,000 testers are on the redesign alpha. However, we will be increasing that number soon and want your community to be ready. [View our roadmap post](https://alpha.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/7gogwu/product_roadmap_update/)   We’ve also begun working on making daily moderation tasks easier so we can reduce your workload. In the redesign, we have updated both mod queues and banning. A few improvements that we think you might like are:  * [Bulk Mod Actions](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif): Instead of taking one action at a time, you can now moderate multiple posts or comments at once. You will also be able to switch to different community modqueues with ease.  * [In-Context Banning](https://i.redd.it/zm2uf29wtnwz.gif): Instead of going to the ban page, you can now ban a user from the post/comment.   Lastly we like you to join our feedback subreddit r/redesign where you can ask fellow redditors for styling help and share your thoughts with us.   Thanks in advance for your help.	human
1426	Actually it's probably just `0`. Timezones are applied after the UTC timestamp, so the user is probably in a negative timezone.  I'm on the pacific coast, so:      &gt; new Date(0)     1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z     &gt; new Date(0).toLocaleString()     '1969-12-31 16:00:00'	human
1427	And unsurprisingly he was compaining about the new profiles and not the beta.  We got a live one.	human
1428	It's currently limited to a small portion of users with plans to expand it soon. idk what it looks like when you get in	human
1429	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile. If you're using a beta release of the Reddit app, try r/RedditAndroidBeta or r/RedditIOSBeta!  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/beta) if you have any questions or concerns.*	human
1430	Yeah, it's a limited alpha, not a beta feature. Only reason I have it is because I'm technically on the mod list of an ex-default. If you aren't a notable user, then there's a decent chance you won't get in the alpha test.	human
1431	"Similar for me but mine is just shouting ""EVERYONE HATES YOU""  Oh  Sorry never mind, that's a mob outside"	human
1432	No worries, I just like the feature a lot hence my enthusiasm :D.  Thanks for the reply!	human
1433	Either vista or 7, or a skin to make it look that way.	human
1434	Nope, Server 2008 R2 Datacenter with Aero Themes enabled and a Windows Vista theme by FediaFedia on Deviantart	human
1435	Server 2008 R2 Datacenter with Aero Themes enabled and a Windows Vista theme because I like the way Vista works and prefer 7's stability and lack of 8/10's bullshit	human
1436	Huh, I’d imagine super old users are also a good group to want in an alpha?  Who knows though 	human
1437	Can you send a pic of what it looks like?	human
1438	"I think right now it's just mods, because I got invited for being a mod in a ""large"" subreddit. (tbh I don't think the subreddit I mod in is large since it only has 72k subs)."	human
1439	[https://imgur.com/a/3yJEw](https://imgur.com/a/3yJEw). FWIW I don't like it and will probably turn it off again. I have to try to get used to it slowly because eventually we won't have a choice, right?   Also when you open a thread it opens in a pop\-up type window over the front page.

1441	I’m not a mod from an ex-default sub and the biggest sub that I mod is 16k. I might’ve signed up for something before though. 	human
1442	"I was given access today stating that I was a mod of a ""large"" sub. Though the subs I mod aren't very large."	human
1443	Mod from /r/Factorio here. We just got invited to the redesign. And we’ve never been a default. They say they’ll be expanding it “very soon”	human
1444	Mine only has 12k and I got that. Unless it's also referring to a large one in only have wiki permission on.	human
1445	They're not going to. There was already so much backlash about it that they decided they were going to keep CSS - that discussion happened almost a year ago.	human
1446	I'm just saying that the notification they sent in my invite explicitly says I was getting it because I'm a mod of a former default sub. Sure, they might have invited some general users as well, but the vast majority of invitees are because of special reasons.	human
1447	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1448	I'm all for adding character to a sub but the CSS should be restricted in scope to prevent tampering with basic functionality and UI. Hiding voting arrows until you subscribe is a common example. I've yet to see any changes to basic UI that were improvements.  Not to mention these changes only affect a subset of users, people that turned off CSS (like me) or mobile users now have the power to vote on those subs, that others do not. Voting is a, if not the primary feature of reddit. 	human
1449	And like a fucking year ago	human
1450	Didn’t they say last night in the discussion sticky that they were keeping it about the same size for a while?	human
1451	I actually really like the threads window, I think it's got a pretty clean-looking design	human
1452	"We've been waiting a while. I'm interested, I hope to see the ""do you want to try reddit's new interface"" soon. "	human
1453	This is why I leave a 1 star review on the play store. 	human
1454	"thanks.. if that thing only supports google calendar and nothing else, I would say that is a pretty useless widget, but I guess I would have to see it to..  They really need a ""rss feed"" widget"	human
1455	...What is that  Might just be my end but that isn’t a face  Anyways  (ง’̀-‘́)ง	human
1456	/r/steam has a nice design but they moved some of the comment links around.  Drives me mad and it's such a basic UX concept that I'm not sure why they did it.  It'd be nice if subs weren't allowed to do that (something they're technically not already).	human
1457	It's a punch &gt;:D  I don't know why it got quoted tho :s	human
1458	Every time I browse Reddit I feel I'm in a different website whenever I change to a different sub, but I understand your point of view. It's ok to want to feel a coherent style between *all* subreddits at the cost of personality, just not why I browse the page :p	human
1459	I'm not gonna hold that to them. Every day here there's a post about how much someone hates the new user profile, and it's not like they're listening to that - and that's a much bigger feature to most users than subreddit CSS.	human
1460	A blank timestamp will equate to 1st January 1970, i.e. 48 years ago.	human
1461	I don't mean automated, because yeah that's basically impossible, but telling a few of the bigger subs to knock it off, and reacting to user reports would go a long way.	human
1462	I really hate how every other sub has a different layout.  I would've been ok with turning off CSS for that reason, but it does have it's positives too.	human
1463	Just the big ones will do... It annoys me to no end on /r/interestingasfuck/ and that's a 1.8 million subscriber one.	human
1464	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1465	Which is RES or Reddit Gold only functionality.  I ran out of gold and don't really want to install a mod to my browser just to browse reddit properly, because some subreddits are assholes.	human
1466	No, please do. CSS is a pox on this website.	human
1467	Easiest way to farm downvotes, but I hope they do get rid of CSS and implement a Reddit specific system that is easy to use without coding. That way it levels the playing field for everyone, but will still allow you to keep the core design of Reddit. 	human
1468	Hey! That's what I said on the last line. Either choose between hardcore all-in CSS or no need to program and use the Reddit official style. Both options are great together and I think they should be a toggle :)	human
1469	It's not about enjoyment, it's about how most subreddits with heavy CSS are ugly as sin, make certain reddit functionalities harder to use and consume a ton more system resources . CSS is horribly abused on this site, more so than automoderator is.	human
1470	Well if you make it a toggle then you kinda defeat the purpose of making it the same everywhere. I'm talking about just being able to choose between colors and put your own images in the banner (and size/spacing and such). But nothing more than that. With CSS you can 'mess up' a lot more stuff, which doesn't make it uniform all over Reddit usability wise. 	human
1471	I disagree. What visually defines Reddit is not the visual style but the wireframe. Whatever sub you browse is bound by Reddit's page structure. Yes, the colours and sprites vary and you can change the look of [the entire sub](/r/pbsod) but it still identifies as Reddit. What's more, I think the slight feeling of browsing different pages makes it a more free-like experience in the terms of what the user can access and find around. Being a highly content-focused site, Reddit's CSS support is a great way of encapsulating the general tone of one page's content and context!	human
1472	They could just append a parent class like `customizable-section` to every rule or something (CSS doesn't have a parent selector yet) and give the customizable sections that class. But yeah not without some difficulty.	human
1473	Can we have a screenshot to how it looks?	human
1474	Oooh thanks for that. I'll give it a try!	human
1475	Not a fan of the pop up window style. Reminds me of opening a tweet on the twitter website. It’s quite clunky on twitter.com. Hopefully it’s better here 	human
1476	"u/timawesomeness  I spoke to one of the engineers working on this last year and they're keeping the CSS but it's not easy ""to have two masters"".     They're working on it, but it's going to be later, this update has had me waiting for a long time and stalled the development of more than one of my subs. that I manage.   For the smaller stuff, this incremental update works for me.   It's not perfect but not everyone has someone that can do a freefolk upgrade from by someone (might have been hired by HBO?) that just approaches the mods and volunteers to do the job for free.   Like I said, I don't like the flat and simple interface that's all the rage now, but I'll work with it to make a few of the subs visually interesting."	human
1477	I had a problem a while back where GIFs simply wouldn't play via any browser. Turns out an app I installed was interfering. It was a file explorer app if that helps.	human
1478	anyone have a filter for this yet? I use pihole so haven't had a need to block something like this before. Just getting started with ublock.	human
1479	I feel like I've stumbled upon a shitty Xanga/MySpace page sometimes. And then some subs fuck with the font size and make it smaller. No idea why they do that. But it's incredibly frustrating.	human
1480	In the current alpha, that's how it is. There's a bunch of WYSIWYG options to change primary color, secondary color, sub icon, opacity, background image, etc. It's pretty nice.	human
1481	People actually use subreddit styling? That's the first thing I make sure is disabled when I go to a new sub. TIL.	human
1482	Some subs are. Others are good, like the ones that use Naut and variants - it's all about how well it's done. Reddit with no CSS is like Craigslist, and that's not a good look either.	human
1483	I don't enjoy a website changing every time I click into another internal page of it. Plus, most of the time the subreddit's I have seen are super gaudy, over the top and a giant waste of time.   I'll stick with RES night mode thanks.	human
1484	&gt; I wouldn't be too worried.  Yeah, they don't have a history of making really stupid decision or anything... /s	human

1503	To compete with the likes of facebook, Reddit needs to do this kind of stuff. Yes, we are the product, and Reddit needs a better product to offer advertisers. Don’t like it? Stop coming here. Stop posting. Make a new Reddit. Discover what it costs to run something like this. They are going to make these changes, because if they don’t they won’t be able to keep the lights on. It’s not 1994 any more. 	human
1504	Make a SFW alt	human
1505	You don't have to, there's a handful of Reddit Clients on the play store	human
1506	I mentioned this in /r/help a month ago , but the wiki hadn't been updated. I dunno if this is low priority but seeing as this is mostly about /r/beta I figured I'd crosspost it here.	human
1507	Yes. Holy Christ. I use the Reddit application sometimes when I want to just check the home page, but the website is infinitely more navigable and allows me to jump straight to the community I'm looking for from the browser that I'm already on.  Also, I don't need everything scaled 1000x for my phone and actually enjoy being able to take in a lot of information at once and deciding what I want to look at from there.  It's my experience, damn it. No means no.	human
1508	But, but, you're not supposed to do that now that Reddit is moving towards a monitize you as the user Facebook model. They need accurate data to sell ads. 	human
1509	More users = more eyes for ads right? /s  I really hate the way Reddit is taking things. I understand they're a business but really it was good the way it was 4 or so years ago and great before that. Now there are too many people posting below par content or, more frequently, reposting below par content. If I knew a good alternative I'd jump to it but it would follow the same cycle. I just want a website to be content with their users and have both strive for quality posts.	human
1510	I think 1:1 is silly, and can be accomplished by simply replying to comment messages or direct ones.  Please enable us to test subreddit-focused chats. The implementation will likely be tricky to place, but you must agree; 1:1 is not what I'm looking for in a chat system.	human
1511	Those 5 seconds (which is only true on a top-of-the-line device) add up. Having to do it over and over again will quickly alienate even the most loyal of users, as you can see from some of the comments on this page.	human
1512	I'm far from deleting my reddit accounts, it's far too useful and engaging IMO. I will, however, never ever use the chat functionality.   I absolutely love the community(-ies), but I treat the management and therefore the whole site the same as Facebook, Google: A necessary evil, ready to sell your whole life for a few bucks of added revenue.	human
1513	I've actually only used reddit on mobile, I had no idea that was a thing, thanks!	human
1514	Alternatively, make the fucking link to go to the reddit site an actual button instead of some puny 8px text that on a good day is barely clickable. 	human
1515	You want me to call a WAHHH-mbulance? Maybe try a little cheese with whine?	human
1516	Wow.  First off, what does this have to do with the beta testing of reddit?  Second, yeah, the_donald is full of trolls and shitposters. It's obvious that they are gonna latch on to any Twitter account that supports their ideologies, be it a Russian mind control superalien or anyone else.  Third, sweet Jesus that's a lot of data and analysis for something that's just basically teenagers trolling on a website. What's the point, honestly? You don't like T_D? Don't subscribe to it. Reddit is great because you can curate your own feed and only pick topics and communities you care about, but instead you are using all that power to try and bring down a community you don't like. It's kinda sad, honestly.	human
1517	There is. Just check it in incognito mode, or when logged out.  May have to look at a parent or child comment. Don't remember exactly.	human
1518	Thats a good question, because as of right now they appear to be exactly the same.  At least for as far down as I cared to compere.	human
1519	Use alerts for Reddit it's a free application for mobile usage	human
1520	"Since we have the chat function right now, it would be pretty neat if the ""share"" option under posts included chats in Reddit. It is pretty inconvenient having to forward a reddit post to facebook messenger when the person I'm forwarding it to already has Reddit."	human
1521	This is not the place for this. A more proper sub would be /r/ideasfortheadmins. This is purely for feedback relating to current desktop beta features, not a catch-all for complaints and requests for reddit as a whole.	human
1522	IFTTT doesn't have an argument to check for stickied posts only, afaik. So you'd get notified everytime a post is made in a Subreddit. 	human
1523	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1524	"Also in replies, and multiple pictures in one post.   I just uploaded two pictures (as ""links"") to my personal sub, opened them both, opened image in new tab, copied URL, and pasted them into the reply I was making. It seemed a little circuitous."	human
1525	That leaves a lot of room for abuse. Maybe something like whisper where you have to exchange a few messages with the other user and only then have the ability to send pictures from your gallery	human
1526	I can agree with that. Maybe even a karma benchmark like some of the subreddits have for posting so bots and dummy accounts don't spam dick pics and stuff. 	human
1527	If you had any chill you would realize the power of Reddit is gonna be the same but with a new picture feature so you don’t need to patronize Facebook   No bigee 	human
1528	it's called feature creep. is the community so fragile that it can't use a different chat app that is already full featured? may as well add photo filters, but then reddit doesn't have any AR guys so that's another $200k just to hire someone that knows what they're doing. and that guy's gonna need a team. and so on and so on, until: cancer. 	human
1529	Doesn’t matter suck a big ole dick boo boo 	human
1530	Just add a prompt for the user to click download. Then the user can decide if they want to download the image or not	human
1531	No.  Just no.  This stupid chat thing is bad enough.  You want to share a photo with someone, reply to them in the thread with a link to imgur. 	human
1532	You probably want to say that in a more active subreddit if you really want to be flooded with dicks.	human
1533	But i dont wanna seem desperate for it. if you get me. It's hard to find a balance. 	human
1534	Boohoo we don't want anyone seeing a penis 	human
1535	There's a huge step up in moderation difficulty, spam detection difficulty, and server resource usage in sending images beyond sending text.  With image posts on a subreddit, at least there's supposed to be a moderation team to delegate responsibilities to and there will probably be more viewers and ads to help cover server costs.	human
1536	Not on a PC I thought.	human

1538	I suspect you are incorrect about that.  I'll bet that they can track your activity even if you're in Incognito Mode and delete cookies on every page load. Even if you use a VPN, probably.	human

1541	Damn, sorry about that! Well, nonetheless, it will help if you're on a desktop Chrome browser :P	human

1543	The beta profile handles subs at the top differently than the rest of reddit. I believe it's just a temporary stand-in until the site-wide redesign which doesn't have subs in the top bar.	human

1562	Brains ability to form connections is faster at younger ages.  Neuroplasticity generally decreases with age you get slower to create the new connections. Best analogy I heard is that like your skin the brain just has a harder time changing and we can work around it bit not reverse.  I am currently working on Dutch which I am not completely proficient in. One of my children is picking it up like there's no effort which both makes me happy and a little jealous. Another one of my children is finding it harder than I do because of dyslexia which really drives home there's a lot more to it than simply age.	human
1563	The answer given is only half correct. Children spend all day every day doing almost nothing but learning language. Every person they are regularly around, and even some that are just passing by, go out of their way to teach the child new words, how to properly form sentences, and how to communicate colloquially. In most cases the child is immersed in the language fully, and have no prior base to build on or alter.   In addition to neuroplasticity, there are a host of environmental factors that make language learning much easier for a child. 	human

1565	Learning something as a child is easier than as an adult, because developing brains are better at things they're accustomed to working towards subjects they were exposed to early on.	human
1566	With the exception of learning your primage language/first language, science has shown that age isn't a large factor in learning a language.    Also, this has nothing to do with r/beta	human
1567	But *can* children learn better?  Young children spend *years* being immersed in their mother tongue before they speak, and then they spend more years progressing from babble to short sentences to longer sentences. It's takes far longer to learn *grammar* to a native level, being developed all the way through your schooling years. And during the first few years, babies are dedicating a lot of energy into just learning that language. They don't have a full adult life to attend to in another language at the same time.   And yet adults can learn phrases in another language in mere minutes. You learn differently, but that different method is probably more efficient that a child has. You already know language, you just need to learn the new rules and new words. A child has to actually build the concept of a language first, and *then* learn the rules and words. 	human
1568	Yeah, it takes small children ~7 years to get decent at a language, once you factor in vocabulary adults want to use. 7-15 year olds can learn quicker if fully immersed.	human
1569	I think a lot of foreign travelers pick up their host language quicker than someone using, say, Duolingo or Rosetta Stone. For example, if I move to Japan for business, that's a pretty foreign language. They don't even use our same alphabet. There's a lot of English there, and a little Japanese goes a long way, as does body language. They're so big on politeness over there, if you have all the mannerisms right, they'll meet you halfway (partly because it's amusing and endearing to them). But if you want to learn... from what I've heard, you basically will. Because you're basically learning like children do, immersively.	human
1570	A very odd question to ask here...	human
1571	"Wrong place, but the only things that ""prevent"" adults from learning are surmountable.  Neuroplasticity is a thing, but it is a much smaller factor than people realize.  And neuroplasticity can actually be changed, even if it can't be at the level of a small child.    First, you have to re-learn how to learn the way you did as a child.  Information has to be accepted straight--non-critically-and not filtered through your existing worldview.    And you have to learn to want it.  Adults don't have the same motivation as children.  Children naturally *want* to emulate language.  That is the natural emotional inclination they have as children, and the social adaptation that also comes more naturally as children is also a  huge factor.  But an adult who already speaks a language, learning another language is probably just a *thing you'd like to do*.  You don't need it in order to communicate or socialize, and even if you *do* there's a part of you that's frustrated that you *just can't speak the langauge you already know*.  You have habits you can fall back on.  You *can* overcome these, but truly wanting these is something you have to learn to do.  There's also the time.  Children who learn languages spend enormous amounts of time being steeped in it, usually exclusively.  Adults who learn as adults generally spend only part of their time using their target language, often spending most of their day in their native language.  It takes a devotion to time and immersion.  If you can do those things *and* leverage your existing linguistic experience, you can actually learn faster than a child.  "	human
1572	I had an interesting thing happen to me a year ago. I had a rather moderately-severe concussion and lost all of my short term memory for several weeks and wasn’t back to completely “normal” thinking for 6 months after the accident. In that time though I kept randomly having thoughts in the second languages I know (German, and Spanish) and I weirdly got a lot of enjoyment out of watching Spanish news and tv shows for awhile. I could understand everything after a while, and now after my brain has been fully healed I became very fluent in Spanish. Which I wasn’t so much so before, even though I knew most of the basics. My brains connections changed and brought up knowledge deep in my brain.    Edit: Also might as well mention in regards to German, I watched stuff online and could pick out the intricacies of various German accents I never noticed before, like I could tell the specific details of how the pronunciation was different, at a level my normal brain couldn't. 	human
1573	The answer is yes, they can. Studies of childhood language acquisition show that children become fluent in their L1 by the age of 7 or so (everyone is different, but the structures are built). Adults, on the other hand, can study a language for a decade or more and never reach comfortable fluency, especially if they weren't conditioned to learn another language in childhood.

1577	**Critical period hypothesis**  The critical period hypothesis is the subject of a long-standing debate in linguistics and language acquisition over the extent to which the ability to acquire language is biologically linked to age. The hypothesis claims that there is an ideal time window to acquire language in a linguistically rich environment, after which further language acquisition becomes much more difficult and effortful.  The critical period hypothesis states that the first few years of life is the crucial time in which an individual can acquire a first language if presented with adequate stimuli. If language input does not occur until after this time, the individual will never achieve a full command of language—especially grammatical systems.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/beta/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28	human
1578	I mean, yeah, but that’s 7 years worth of immersion. Most adults who study for decades study a few hours a day at MOST, and go right back out of class and don’t hear the language they’re learning until they go back to class. 	human
1579	For real, if you're an adult and you learned as slowly as a child, you'd be disappointed. As a college student, I went from speaking no  Japanese to speaking conversational Japanese within two years, of which only 3 months were actually in Japan. My Japanese was way better than a two year old's! Children are just better at having a DGAF attitude towards communicating and accents, but at speed of learning per se they are quite poor, and a motivated adult can easily outpace them.	human
1580	An adult who spends all of their time immersed in a language will be fluent in way less than 7 years. Depending on the difficulty of the change from the language they already know, it will only take one or two years (again, given full immersion). 	human
1581	Mostly laziness.  Loss of some neuroplasticity as we age, as /u/nethack47 mentioned is a factor, also, but mostly laziness. 	human
1582	&gt;  Japanese within two years, of which only 3 months were actually in Japan. My Japanese was way better than a two year old's!  this made me laugh, and is a good point	human
1583	Not a medical prof. Here's my take on it. That's all a kid does for the most part. Especially as a baby, they just sit there and observe. They're put in this world where things are communicating without them. Basic instincts would push them into wanting to learn and communicate with the rest of the world. Same concept as putting a someone in a foreign country that speaks a different language. They have to pick up that new language pretty quick to survive for the most part. You'd be surprised how fast someone will learn a language if they absolutely have to. 	human
1584	Studies suggest that people that resettle in a new country after a certain age range (8-12) will never quite master the new language of their new country to the same degree as actual native speakers of that country. Usually they struggle to master the grammar (especially functional morphology) to the same degree. They actually may speak very well, to the extent  that during brief or general conversations you might never guess it's not their native language, but eventually they will make mistakes that actual native speakers would never make. 	human
1585	The plasticity if a developing brain, you could say children's brain is made to learn, to adapt and to absorb as much knowledge as possible. Adult's brains on the other hand have fully developed and are better applying the stuff learned and all that junk	human
1586	 It's a nice break from people whining about the admins making Reddit for ｎｏｒｍｉｅｓ though	human
1587	The main thing preventing it is that adults are usually not willing to do the same things that they did as a child.  Studies show that adults learn faster than young kids, *if* they are willing to subject themselves to the same exposure.    This includes starting out with several hours of babeling, which helps learn the new sound system.  An example that I have worked with myself, both as a teacher and a student is [The Silent Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Way).  There are also other effective approaches.  As a founder and first Secretary-Treasurer of the Japan Association of Language Teachers, I was able to work with Dr. Caleb Gattegno.	human
1588	"According to my elementary school language teachers, the best time to learn a language is pre-5 years old. The second best time is ""before puberty,"" and your cut-off to not having a noticeable accent is around 18-20 (so if you start, say, French at 15 you could wind up with no noticeable accent, but if you start at 21, you're fighting an uphill battle there).  So...start now?"	human
1589	I am a linguist. 	human
1590	Yeah, true, assuming full immersion it can take significantly less time, but that also depends on the person - there are a lot of factors at play, like one's early exposure to languages other than their native language/L1. Anecdotally, though there is evidence to support this being the case elsewhere, since I grew up speaking English and Japanese I'm better prepared to learn other languages; I learned Norwegian to a B1-B2 level in ~six months. 	human
1591	Linguistics grad student here. You’re not wrong, but the rabbit hole is deeper. As humans we’re language learning machines. We’re genetically predisposed for language, like birds and flying. Chomsky suggested that we have a “language acquisition device” in our brains that is most susceptible to being utilized during a time called the “critical period.”(0-7ish years). Lots of animals have a critical period for a particular skill(cats given an eyepatch during early periods of life NEVER gain sight in that eye), ours is language. The L.A.D. NEEDS to activate, and the brain NEEDS to pickup language(s) during the first 7-12 years of life, or a child will never become proficient in any language (Even having no language input within the first 7 years can have lasting effects).	human
1592	"The early stages of brain development offer a lot more flexibility for this. The hype around the ""Your Child Can Read"" going around on TV about the first 5 years of life is in fact true-to the point where kids learning multiple languages in that timeframe will develop duplicates of the parts of the brain responsible for speech, reading, comprehension, etc, one for each language learned in that time. We lose this plasticity as we grow older."	human
1593	OP's account is over a month old with no other posts in their history. I found it strange seeing how their post received a bunch of upvotes and comments, considering it has nothing to do with this sub.	human
1594	But the aim of an adult learner is never to be fluent, or at least it never *should* be their aim. The adult goal is to learn a language to a workable level. Maybe some people just want to be able to order coffee without worrying about what they said, and maybe others want to be able to work in the language. B2 in German is the level required to do a Masters degree in Germany and C2 is required for a PhD. You could reach those levels in a matter of months if you really worked hard, but good luck getting a newborn to that level of proficiency in the same timeframe.   Adult learners are different learners precisely because we already have a language. My point is that that doesn't make us slower learners.	human
1595	"Well right after the accident I had no memory at all first day after I woke up(woke up in my bed in lots of pain, my friend sent me note explaining what happened, the accident, etc.) I didn't even know who I was. But the first few days my longer term memories came back. I felt less anxiety about boundaries between people, for instance I started talking to friends of mine that I had become distant from and normally in my mind I would think that person isn't close enough to talk to, but right after the accident I started talking to many people I hadn't talked to for a long while. But I couldn't form any real short term memories. I would be using the computer and had no indication of how much time had gone by(4 hours passing by would seem like 10 minutes), or what I had been doing 2 minutes beforehand. I was able to have a weird sense of ""extreme concentration"" on the activity I was currently doing because I was unable to get distracted by other thoughts, since I couldn't remember. My brain was incapable of any sort of multitasking. I was unable to work my normal job during this phase obviously. This stage lasted for several weeks (at least 4-6 or so), after that I started to have more control over my short term memory and able to recall things quite a bit better. But my overall brain function seemed hazy for several months(I would try to remember focusing on something, but it would almost seem as if the memory I was targeting was there, but the connection couldn't be made. By now my brain function seems normal, and in some ways I feel different than I had. Because I focused on watching spanish shows during my injury phase I picked up and can understand people speaking spanish perfectly, although I'm not confident at speaking it. I almost feel somewhat smarter than I was before, as if I challenged my brain enough when it was healing, that I now have better connections in some ways. I was sort of depressed for awhile, when I was never sure when I would be back to normal. There's cases of people getting a relatively minor-seeming concussion, and then they have permanent brain damage. I was very scared for some time, and had little hope that I would improve. But now looking back(it's almost exactly a year since the accident, my brain is fully functioning, in some ways I feel better than before. "	human

1597	So our Son is a little over 1 years, I speak to him in Swedish as often as I can (we're both from the US but my moms Swedish), mainly weekends and when we get home with him after work.    Her parents (which are also his day-sitters when we work) are multilingual and speak French, Spanish, Hebrew and Arabic. They mainly speak to him in English, but sometimes in French (although we push them to speak French with him more often)... when we're at their house I hear them speak French to him, but not sure for rest of time/day.    When he starts daycare, there are a lot of Spanish speaking teachers and we'd be open to him being spoken to in Spanish.   Are we messing him up with so many different languages thrown at him at such an early age? I'm happy if he ends up speaking Swe, and French (not incl. English obviously).  But is pushing Spanish on him too soon gonna screw with his language forming skills (or defer him from speaking at all until a later age)?  Happy to hear from all types of people on this.. u/Cho_Zen if you have input, would love to hear since you're a lingo grad student.  Thanks all!  	human

1601	I think there’s actually some debate as to whether adults really are slower at learning languages. Sure, there’s the neuroplasticity angle. But we also have to consider that children are not expected to talk about very complex things. While a child learning how to ask for food in three languages might be amazing. A functioning adult would be expected to speak about things as mundane as directions to their opinions about local news. 	human

There needs to be a distinction made between learning a second language and being raised in a bilingual environment. Being raised in a bilingual environment is the *only* way children can learn a second language. You can't sit a preschooler down and teach them Chinese. They can't handle the abstract concepts yet, even if they had the focus and patience, which they don't.  An adult who can grasp the abstract concepts of language and who puts their will towards it, in a supportive, immersive, environment, can learn a second language far faster than a child.  Anecdotes don't make for evidence, but I've taught ESL and EFL classes to a wide age range of students. The best you can hope for with kids under ten is that you can teach them enough that they will be capable and comfortable asking for help, or communicating the idea that they don't speak English and maybe indicating what language they do speak. Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever taught EFL to anyone that young, probably because it'd be pointless. ESL students in America on the other hand are usually immigrants and are better motivated to learn their new ""native"" language. Either way, their parents learn faster, up to a point. After a certain age I think the motivation isn't there, or is less."	human
1606	I tried this a few days ago, no good.  r/strugglefucking mods got invited to the redesign so I had them invite me as a mod so I could get a sneak peak at how reddit plans to rape this place, but this didn't work either.	human
1607	I think it's only sent out to people who have been mods of a mid-large subreddit for at least a month. You might have awhile to wait	human
1608	Ah, I demodded myself because I have no interest in that sub.  It’s a shame that Reddit is so heavily stacking the redesign feedback in favor of moderators over users. 	human
1609	Their experience is vastly different from a user who primarily uses the site in other ways though.  I strongly disagree that they are the best to voice concern.	human
1610	I (a mod of /r/technology) got it. I hated it and switched back after a few days of using it.	human
1611	Well, as a mod I know personally that I just browse the site normally 90% of the time. Maybe that's not average, maybe it is	human
1612	A historical linguist, so not quite as far as someone researching language acquisition as you, but still fairly far removed.  That said, I'm big enough to admit when I'm wrong. After a little more digging, I realize that a more modern understanding of language acquisition is against me here. I'm looking back on my undergraduate education, specifically the class I took on language acquisition almost a half decade ago, and I'm wondering why they weren't teaching any current research.   I digress. Long story short, I'm a dingus. 	human
1613	I think the idea is that whilst users as a whole are valuable, individual users come and go naturally. Subs are controlled by a small number of moderators, and with subs being the lifeblood of Reddit, they want to keep the kids happy. You piss off the mods, they walk and could take the subs down with them (e.g. when most defaults went private for a day in protest). Therefore, getting it right for the mods is the main thing they're worried about.	human
1614	That will happen eventually. At this point, it really isn't finished enough for that which would just result it a ton of complaints about missing functionality that already planned to be added.	human
1615	Plot twist: site would likely be better if those mods walked.  The mods already dictate too much about site content, their feedback should not be given more priority than the userbase as a whole.  The more reddit caters to mods over users the worse this place is going to get.	human
1616	This is why you list known issues/planned features alongside such a release.  All this feature planning without getting feedback from the most common end user perspective (the reader) is quite dangerous when those are the class of users that as a whole will determine if the redesign is a success or a failure. 	human
1617	The reason Reddit has good content, is that mods are able to sieve out the bad content. Downvoting works to a degree, but mods keep content relevant to the sub.	human
1618	It redirects and afaik, those on the redesign have had a message to say so	human
1619	Well at the moment, reddit.com is the old design and alpha.reddit.com is the terrible one. I suppose once the update goes live it'll be a perma-switch.   I don't get why everyone is looking forward to it, it's terrible. 	human
1620	Supposedly they are soliciting feedback at r/redesign  I'd like to give it a fair shake and contribute ideas before it gets set in (reported to be terrible) stone	human
1621	I'm on the beta feed and I'm just a user. 	human
1622	Found the guy who thinks he knows what moderating a large subreddit is like.	human
1623	At LEAST include a login box on it, so those of us who simply have auto-clearing cookies can get it away with one click.	human
1624	The beta beaker isn't built into the new profile page.   Suggested workaround: green highlighter and a post\-it note.	human
1625	With the entire army of science that /r/science has established for comment pruning, stuff still goes well over a day without getting pruned despite being a clear rules violation. I see it every time I open up the mod queue. How the hell do you think reddit would afford to hire moderators to cover every sub when it's already not profitable.	human
1626	Mods as a whole are great, but there is definitely quite a few mods(especially some big mods and/or big subs) that ruin the experience for a lot of users because of their actions. There is big subs that many leave because of mod abuse that Reddit just ignores.	human
1627	"&gt; stuff still goes well over a day without getting pruned despite being a clear rules violation.  A violation of site wide rules, or the heavy restrictions r/science chooses to impose on its userbase?  &gt; How the hell do you think reddit would afford to hire moderators to cover every sub when it's already not profitable.  Where the hell do I suggest they hire moderators?  Reddit's strength has been and should continue to be it's relatively hands off approach to content.  Reddit seems to be going in the exact opposite direction and catering to the ""needs"" of moderators who want heavy control over their community rather than providing any tools so that users know just how heavily moderators are removing content and what content it is that they are removing.  I want to see the return of large spaces where people are free to speak their mind without excessive intervention of moderators. "	human
1628	What you want is the freedom to walk down a street that's covered in litter and suspicious brown piles.  Still, at least there wouldn't be any damned custodians telling you not to throw your trash on the sidewalk, right?	human
1629	&gt;That way you get more feedback and it's not a complete disaster when you release it.  I'm not sure it'll help when all the feedback is negative and they go forward with it anyway. 	human
1630	No, I think the banning of r/jailbait made sense and I wouldn't be bothered to see voat ban content in that style for the same reasons it didn't bother me when reddit did it.  &gt; We understand that this might make some of you worried about the slippery slope from banning one specific type of content to banning other types of content. We're concerned about that too, and do not make this policy change lightly or without careful deliberation. We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal. However, child pornography is a toxic and unique case for Internet communities, **and we're protecting reddit's ability to operate by removing this threat.** We remain committed to protecting reddit as an open platform.  https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/ 	human
1631	Yeah, because there's nothing like trying to have a scientific conversation where everyone is piling on jokes and talking about their own tangentially related anecdote. Hell, I have a sub that I'm the sole moderator and follower of since it never got off the ground and it has still has a guy that just started to spam it literally this week. No moderation doesn't mean that all of a sudden users get their voice again.	human
1632	"Since we've been using /r/Science as an example, let's go back to that: Suppose a user submits an article that is clearly a joke. Users find it entertaining, so they upvote it, despite the fact that it goes completely against the subReddit's intended purpose. Unless I've misunderstood, your perspective is that the article should be allowed to remain; that there shouldn't be any rules at all, save for those determined by the in-the-moment whims of whoever might happen to be viewing the site at the time.  If that's the case, why have distinct communities at all?   SubReddit rules are in place for good reasons... but it sounds like what you really want is anarchy, and that any attempts at structuring things is abhorrent to you. ""Oh, your restaurant requires me to wear clothing?! Well, you're a bunch of fascists!"" It's all well and good to adopt that perspective from an external point of view, but the people running things – the ones emptying the trash, cleaning the tables, sweeping the floors, and keeping raccoons from doing their business in the kitchen – have a responsibility to their other patrons (or in the case of Reddit, to their subscribers).  If you don't like rules or structure, you're welcome to leave."	human
1633	Part of moderators being given access to alpha is to enable them to use the redesign tools to stylise the subreddit and add back information. That way when users do join there is more to test. Without adding in the widgets for example, users can't test them, having a variety of designs can highlight a problem that would get missed if everything remained in the default state.   It's still early stages so plenty of time for users to feedback as well. 	human
1634	\&gt; If that's the case, why have distinct communities?  I'm not against distinct communities or moderation, I just think reddit also needs a more encompassing place that is less distinct.  r/reddit.com coexisted alongside other subreddits.	human
1635	Why not start a community of your own, then?	human
1636	well r/all and r/popular are a good amalgamation of that.  You can also create your own subreddit without any additional rules bar the site wide ones.	human
1637	No discoverability, and the existing large subreddits tend to be hostile towards subreddits that do not moderate as heavily.  The average user hears that reddit is a relatively \(compared to facebook\) unrestricted place and decides they want to talk politics.  The logical place for them to go is r/politics not to have to go hunting to realize that r/worldpolitics or r/libertarian these days is probably your best bet for unrestricted political debate.  How is a typical user even supposed to realize how heavily the moderators remove content when reddit provides no visibility into this whatsoever?  Why did the moderators of these formerly free\-er spaces not create new spaces when they wanted more heavy control over what was posted?	human
1638	"I acctually got banned from commenting on a different account in /r/politics for playing devils advocate to popular concensus on multiple posts.  EG: Just to play devils advocate, term limits on the president arguably stop a qualified canidate from continuing to improve the country.  I'd just drop comments like that on various posts and let people think why that's good or bad and generally have a discussion. When I messaged the mods on that account they said I was banned for, ""Encouraging arguments""..."	human
1639	I get it every time I load the page. I see this popup on page 1, page 2, page 3, ….  Also, who puts a popup on the front page of a website? If I didn't know about reddit and stumbled upon the site, I would have left immediately. The same thing happened for me with Twitter when they started forcing you to create an account to see a user's media or followers on mobile. I don't go there anymore.	human
1640	Unfortunately this is the only admin-sponsored subreddit that allows users to post, so that's what happens. If they opened up a sort of feedback subreddit, that'd be great, but there's no such thing at the moment (correct me if I'm wrong).  Anyway, I got [this message](https://i.imgur.com/euw2ei2.png) and don't know where else to complain about how poorly written it is, like did no one proofread before sending this out or...?	human
1641	Oh, I hate Pinterest for that, too, you scroll down a little bit and BAM, popup 	human
1642	I just made a random sub to get here :P	human
1643	You're displeased with something you know very little about? Seems a little willfully ignorant to me.	human
1644	This has annoyed me too.  I usually only lurk here from a laptop machine.  So, at least for my use case, I figured out how to get rid of this annoying pop-up.  I installed Greasemonkey (a Firefox add-on that allows users to modify web pages automatically - there is an equivalent for other browsers) and created a [user script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/38789-reddit-login-popup-removal) that removes the popup.  Fight the man!	human
1645	I get this because I clear my cookies on browser close so its very annoying. If its to get more users, you could just have a login splash like twitter does.	human
1646	You're not wrong.  Running servers and paying developers is expensive.  Personally, I'm going to keep using ad blocking and creating other workarounds (see the Greasemonkey script I posted) and stay logged out for as long as they aren't forcing a login to see anything.  I would rather web companies start charging for content.  Ads and tracking are bullshit, I hate them, and it allows stupid nonsense (listicles, fake news, etc.) to survive and thrive because people can just casually consume content all day.  If they had to pay, they would have to pick and choose, and hopefully better content will win.	human
1647	I was making a website for someone once and they wanted something like that to pop up when the user was on the site for a few seconds. I think the people who want these sorts of features just aren't in-touch with the people who visit the websites themselves. It's more of a.. industry norm to have them, I guess?	human
1648	Short answer: No, you’re not messing up your kid with all the different input.   There COULD be minor language delays within the first 2 years, but that evens out by year three. (The reason is, the brain ‘gravitates’ towards hearing particular cadence, rhythm, and TYPES of sounds specific to a particular language) The brain stays open for selecting languages, and if the child decides to be multilingual, the child’s vocabulary(for a specific language) will be limited until cognitive ability increases(knowing 50 words/language in a bilingual kid = 100 total lexical items, i.e words)  So expose the kid, and reinforce as many as the kid chooses to use during the critical period, it’s the best period for language acquisition.	human
1649	I agree wholeheartedly. TANSTAAFL. I will pay for quality. This is why I pay for Spotify and Netflix, and sponsor a number if YouTube creators in Patreon.  Reddit Prime with no ads, no tracking and no data collection? Hell yeah, sign me up.   The tricky part is rolling something like that out after the fact without causing a mutiny. 	human
1650	I loved linguistics (my major is Psych.) but I remember the lectures. I learnt ballet until the age of 16 and the syllabus is in French so I learnt a lot of french words but very little grammar until high school. I still recall all the words but struggle with the grammar. That's why if I had children, I'd have made sure they learnt a different language at primary school age.	human
1651	Yea, it’s a trip. As adults, we’re much better than children at memorizing words and such. But grammar is a crazy skill. We know so much about grammar in our native language, enough to KNOW when something doesn’t sound right, all the nuances. Children absorb it (acquire) through input alone.   A string of words made into a sentence is really an unending stream of sounds. Children are able to parse it all out into words, phrases, and eventually internalize grammar. An immense task for a little human who can’t figure out how to wipe their ass, or even object permanence.	human
1652	There’s a link right there, are you saying it’d be better design to have a signup and login form (three boxes) all at once?	human
1653	The better design would be no popup at all, it's trashy and corporate.  Right now, when it pops up, a user has one of two thoughts:  A) How the fuck do I get rid of this? B) Just let me log the fuck in to get rid of this.  Making it two clicks to get rid of to log in encourages just closing it with the X, one click, instead of logging in or signing up which is their desired outcome.  So make it one fucking click, or just remove the thing.	human
1654	I never got a PM, but I got a banner when I logged into reddit a few weeks ago. 	human
1655	"This is just as annoying as the ""go to our mobile app"" bait-and-switch sticky footer thing you get when accessing reddit through a mobile device, where the ""no thanks"" text is so small 50% of the time you end up clicking the ""ok, let's go to the play store"" button instead. They're just as likely to remove this as they're likely to remove that, because it brings ""engagement""."	human
1656	It's a norm for people who think they'll earn more money that way. They think people will eventually succumb and register/sign up for the newsletter/etc. but what they don't know is that people are much more prone to simply looking for a different website, because there are loads.	human
1657	My only question: why isn't the login box in the first screen anymore? Before, there was a login box right on the first screen, so it would be 1 click to login. Now, it's actually 1 more click to login, so harder then before. Why would you want that? That makes me want to login less often and I guess that wasn't the point of creating this pop-up?	human
1658	"There's a tiny little ""Skip for now"" on it, but I usually just start making new accounts when sites/software force me to login. It's easier than deleting your history."	human
1659	I'm pretty sure sites only do this to increase their user numbers.   I say help 'em out and make a new account every time the popup asks.  Think I'm headed over to /r/MaliciousCompliance for a while...😈	human
1660	&gt; If I didn't know about reddit  I think what a lot of people fail to consider is that Reddit has mostly saturated demographics like yours (engineer, and I assume pretty tech savvy). For the most part, they are looking to capture users from many other demographics and *those users* don't have the same feelings about popups that you do. They don't need to worry too much about how you would react if you were new to Reddit, because you're already here.  I expect, in time, they will see that they need to swing back a bit once a younger generation of tech people (who don't Reddit now) start being alienated, but that's a future problem.	human
1661	I'm a big fan of consent.  I do hope reddit as a company fails at this point and will continue to hope for this until they return to their former principles of freedom of expression.  I'm in the redesign now, it's not quite as bad as I was hoping for, still may do the trick though.	human
1662	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile. If you're using a beta release of the Reddit app, try r/RedditAndroidBeta or r/RedditIOSBeta!  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1663	In the meantime you can use something like Pushbullet to push a page to your mobile device.	human
1664	You have to join on desktop. Go to your preferences on the desktop version and there should be a beta option.	human
1665	https://reddit.com/profile-beta-confirmation  you have to go to it in a browser.	human
1666	Yeah I was going to suggest that. You just favorite and bam you have it in a nice list across devices. 	human
1667	It works on iOS. If you're browsing reddit on a mac, you can open the same page in the official app using the handoff icon in the app switcher.	human
1668	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1669	That's not a [current beta feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/wiki/current_features), so I think this is the wrong sub.	human
1670	"All votes on reddit are 'fuzzed', so the number you see isn't necessarily the exact number of upvotes on the post. This helps to prevent abuse from spammers and voting rings, and isn't just a beta feature — it happens on all reddit clients and is an intrinsic feature of the system.  See also [the reddit faq](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq):  &gt; A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed""."	human
1671	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1672	You cannot change flairs on the official mobile apps or the mobile site. You need to use the desktop site or a third-party app.  This has absolutely nothing to do with the beta program and would be more suited to /r/redditmobile or /r/help.	human
1673	Sounds like a shadowban	human
1674	Not really. This is a sub for beta website features, not the mobile site or app. 	human

1677	Since you’re a new user, check out this link to get familiar with what reddit is and how it works: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddit_101  If you have any questions about reddit itself, feel free to post them in /r/help but be sure to read the sidebar for rules and FAQs as well as search the subreddit to see if your question has already been asked/answered. 	human
1678	I don't know about aids. Maybe the herp ... either way, it's something you don't want. Unlike those, this should be curable.  Thanks for the report, we'll be taking a look.	human
1679	Yeah, everything must be a conspiracy. It doesn’t make any sense that a website with a user base primarily of millennials might just prefer left-leaning media, *that* would be crazy.	human
1680	Yep, it's 1:1 to a certain point. Not sure when it no longer is 1:1 when it's positive but I believe -10 karma is the threshold for comments and posts.	human
1681	time is a factor i've noticed.	human
1682	That's a great point, but diluting this sub with off topic posts is not a solution to the absence of a general feedback sub. Diluting this sub will make it as you described: largely ignored by the admins in practice	human
1683	Well the issue is that the mods here are all admins who don't really have time to spend moderating they sub. If they appointed some community mods to removed the non-beta stuff it would help a lot.	human
1684	I dunno i have grown a fondness for r/askbeta	human
1685	"Is there a way to turn this off?   I don't want to login just to browse the ""front page of the Internet"".   I don't get this popup at home, just when at work.  Not on mobile. "	human
1686	yeah you have a great point there. I didn't realize all the mods were employees. some community mods would do the trick. I guess I'm dreaming of a reddit where users use voting to self moderate off topic content and that's what's so frustrating here, but who am I kidding.	human
1687	This. Especially given the fact that a lot of people are not conte t creators, and for most your comment karma will be significantly higher.	human
1688	...Or if it actually showed how much karma you had. What my profile reports as my post karma total is a tiny fraction of what you get if you add my posts together. How in the hell does that make sense?	human
1689	Chat isn’t a beta feature anymore. 	human
1690	IKR. I had a post on r/todayilearned which got 22k upvotes, but the amount of *karma* I've gotten from that sub is about 5k. What's the point in it existing if the number is deliberately lowered?	human

1693	Would it make a difference if we found out the simulation in which we live is itself just a huge beta test?	human
1694	Karma doesn't count 1 for 1 , it also doesn't count your own upvote. Karma is kinda pointless, outside of the initial amount needed to make a subreddit, and post more than once every ten minutes(this works on a Subreddit basis though, so it can change quickly) [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#wiki_how_does_karma_work.3F)	human
1695	If it averages with the downvotes, My Karma will probably go down after A week on /r/politics... 	human
1696	I believe it is literally only there to give people a sense of validation, and an easy way to quickly glance at someone else's profile to get an idea of how active they are. Them not doing 1 for 1 kinda makes sense though, if you created an account 5 years ago and had one epic submission, should you have more karma than a daily user who makes quality submissions, but to smaller subreddits so they never hit the front page?	human
1697	it's just a suggestion, jesus. 	human
1698	LOL I didn't mean OP was the one masturbating to traps. But that the people who crave Karma are the ones who need to validate themselves. The traps was just a joke.  but also traps aren't gay so that shouldn't matter anyways /s	human
1699	Even if you create content, the karma you get by answering questions or making a joke in the comments in your own post usually add up to more karma than the Post.  Especially with tech stuff and memes.	human
1700	True. I made one comment on a post and it has upwards of 20% of the karma the post has	human
1701	what a punch of homophobes.	human
1702	And it's weird how a portion of the karma disappears into thin air. I'd get 3.0k upvotes on a post (for example) and just 2.0k will actually be on my profile.	human
1703	r/findareddit is a better place to ask for recommendations like this.	human
1704	If you're a newbie, you probably shouldn't be in the beta program.	human
1705	Firstly, you're incorrect, as you can see from the text in brackets, this is feedback. Beta features are there for a reason, and I'm giving feedback on the Karma system, so /r/ideasfortheadmins would not be a good place for that.  Secondly, I am on a travel device which I will not be installing any additional software on, so that is not applicable to me, though I appreciate the sentiment.  Thirdly, If they have already made that change, then you just contradicted your first point, which would mean your comment is not adding to this conversation. Thanks, I guess.	human
1706	That sounds like a very interesting experiment. Well, I'm off to do something *totally unrelated* to your suggestion ;)	human
1707	Some subs require a certain amount of comment and/or post karma to post. See: [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/). 	human
1708	Posts and comments don't have karma, they have scores. Votes do not have a 1:1 relationship with scores, and scores do not have a 1:1 relationship with karma. A post score is used to determine how it ranks, while karma indicates how you've contributed to reddit, and those are closely related but not the same thing.	human
1709	This was a temporary (and strange) bug in our first deploy this morning. It should be fixed for everyone now, but please let us know if you still see it anywhere. Sorry bout that	human
1710	You should be able to start a chat with anyone on reddit by either using the button on their profile or typing their exact username into the new chat flow. Let us know if that doesn’t work for you anywhere though and we can look into it.	human
1711	How do I turn off chat? It's constantly taking up close to a quarter of the bottom right of my screen. 	human
1712	I just experienced the chat for the first time, and it was a box sitting in the lower right corner of my browser window on top of other stuff, just getting in the way, with no way to turn it off. Drove me nuts. I immediately googled how to block it in uBlock so now it's gone.  Was it really supposed to be that way?	human
1713	I have a relatively large amount of karma buy I couldn't care less.  All it does is show I spend too much time on reddit	human
1714	sorry, posted in wrong place. But I have a meme economy post with 10k https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/80jnvg/my_investment_in_a_format_seen_here/ I only see 9000 on my profile	human
1715	Hi. I thought you were talking about the next Button. Like, r/rutton was making a comeback. Your thing is cool too. Good luck.	human
1716	Thanks for the legacy mode, new mode is a huge pain.	human
1717	Already changed in the alpha redesign.  I kind of wish there were a sticky in this sub asking people to avoid desktop suggestions because there's a high chance whatever is being suggested is no longer relevant.  In the off chance someone reading this is in the alpha, feedback should go in /r/redesign.	human
1718	We released the fix and you should be able to close it now so it isn't intrusive. Sorry - that was a miss on our part - the close buttons weren't showing for that intro screen. Thanks for reaching out.	human
1719	I don't and I never said I did. It was a suggestion, do you know what that is?	human
1720	huh thanks, good to know. I've just been to a couple that never seem to change even though there active subs.	human
1721	Karma isn't a current feature? lmao	human
1722	"Maybe because you made a post on a website known for people making posts where other people comment on them? His reply was a perfectly valid one, he stated an opinion. Perhaps many more people agree or disagree with you, the only way to find out would be to consider the input of users. Even even if their opinion differs from yours, or suggest things you agree or disagree with pertinent to the post.   Would you rather have 1000 replies of ""I agree!""   I am appointing you 2 million floppy rainbow points. They are of equal value to karma, and can be traded, bartered, exchanged, for nothing. Also they have a cooler sounding name, according to some. "	human
1723	No. I don't believe I need to have a /s every single time I say something even remotely snarky. We're adults. We can use context clues when there isn't tone.	human
1724	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile. If you're using a beta release of the Reddit app, try r/RedditAndroidBeta or r/RedditIOSBeta!  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/beta) if you have any questions or concerns.*	human
1725	Also you can double tap. But now it's so much harder to go to a persons profile...	human
1726	Yeah the real issue is - if the app updates, pop up a fucking changelog after opening so we know when changes are made.    Software dev isn’t hard yet we somehow manage to forget the easiest part - people use the app. 	human
1727	Ah, how mature, making a feedback post somehow about you. 	human
1728	I’m able to do a long tap to collapse now. Not sure that’s on all devices or not. I’m on iOS btw. 	human
1729	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1730	I've commented about this before, it boils down to the fact that the new profiles don't have any reactive css, and therefore the profiles do not react to resizing of the window.  This can be easily fixed with:          .ProfileTemplate, .ProfileTemplate__body, .ProfileTemplate__content {       width: unset !important;      }      .ProfileTemplate__body {       padding-right: 32px !important;       --x-sidebar-width: 344px;      }      .ProfileTemplate__content {       max-width: calc(100% - var(--x-sidebar-width) - 32px) !important;      }  Which will auto scale the content to fit the screen. For an easy-to-use solution, use this:  https://userstyles.org/styles/147463/reddit-profiles-reduce-width  I hope this helps, it does make the new profiles a little easier to use.	human
1731	You can also swipe to collapse - it's a toggle in the settings.	human
1732	I think that the switching to the next post is a cool feature but I think the gesture needs to be different. maybe something similar to the button on the bottom right corner that jumps to the next comment. I immediately turned swiped to hide comments back on in settings.	human
1733	It’s super annoying. Others have already said what the update is.   Small vent: shows a complete lack of understanding user experience. I now have to double tap to collapse comments which means twice as many “clicks” to do the same experience as before. Or I have to hold which doubles the time I’m spending collapsing a comment I’ve already read. Sheesh the point of an update is to make an experience better or easier.	human
1734	The bigger problem is we can't collapse parts of a comment-thread, only the whole thing.	human
1735	There’s a setting you can turn off	human
1736	Blocking works (at least I think, I don’t know if they tried to message again).  When reporting though, I think the most fitting category is “Impersonation”. I just feel there needs to be an explicit “Spam” option when reporting a user to better track who is spamming for quicker deletion. 	human
1737	I can't help much other than telling you to block everyone sending you spam, really, it's super easy and fast. Sounds like a waste of time when you can just easily block them, have you clicked the gear icon top right of the chat? There's a block option to block every spammer you come across, or is that, like, too much of a hassle? I don't agree nor do I agree with you. I don't mind that option but the block option, to me, seems like the best way to handle spammers.	human
1738	Blocking is very easy, I agree, and adding a Spam report option isn’t necessary. I just thought that by getting reported as explicit Spam will cause the account to get deleted, stop that account from spreading, and keep the number of Spambots lower than if they didn’t get explicitly flagged but only blocked.   It could be more effort to add than its worth but I just felt that it’d be helpful in the long run. 	human
1739	I totally agree with you, it'd definitely be very helpful in the long run. Haha, thanks to you, this chat thing will be a much cleaner and homely place to be in.	human
1740	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1741	I feel like a menu that slides over when a menu button is clicked with all the sidebar features would work great 	human

1743	Double tap to collapse a comment, long press to collapse the entire chain.  https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile/comments/811g45/tifu_by_changing_comment_gestures_that_users/	human
1744	Yeah I don’t like this. My phone vibrates slightly when a comment is collapsed too. Now my SO knows what I’m doing on my phone every night when we’re going to sleep. 	human
1745	I don't know how I suddenly am no longer part of the beta feature set. I don't know how I could have gotten a profile without that, and I was pretty sure I had opted-in to it several months ago. I just re-selected beta in my preferences.	human
1746	Posts like these *really* solve the problem, guys! They're under every thread ever, and you can see it's doing absolutely nothing, so we must keep complaining to the guys who post a single time in this subreddit and never again! Great change, guys! We're making a difference! This is the wrong subreddit~!	human
1747	Or people can just read the damn sidebar before they make a post in a subreddit. That's just too difficult isn't it.	human
1748	I don’t have a beta version but I would absolutely love an easier way to collapse and otherwise navigate comments. I scroll around and read comment sections way more often than I upvote comments. 	human
1749	I frequently would accidentally tap a username when trying to collapse comments. Now it’s double tap to collapse and hold to go to username. It took me a bit to figure out what the changes were but once I did I like it better. Less accidental collapsing/user page views. 	human
1750	It sounds like you're talking about the mobile app. Could you post your question to a more specific subreddit?   Try asking in r/RedditMobile.

1751	I like it. Swiping is actually a pretty big motion for something that you do like thirty times per thread. 	human
1752	Not harder buy I got used to double tap upvoting and now it's a bit annoying. 	human
1753	Scrolling doesn't cause a tap, and the touchscreen ignores accidental taps.	human
1754	You used to be able to swipe left on a comment to collapse it too; now it takes you to the next post. So annoying	human
1755	Glad it works for you.   I've checked all the settings. I'm using the internal browser, and it's too much of a coincidence that the update broke it when I've never encountered a single issue before.	human
1756	It's a beta, testing changes is the whole point...	human
1757	Maybe someone can create a **plugin** for browsers. I think it's not really hard, but who am I to judge. I'm just a designer... kill me pls.	human
1758	They gave a good explanation as to why the changes occurred. They’re changing it back, anyway. 	human
1759	But it was a single tap on a very small sliver of screen. If there is a link posted on the first line of the comment, I get taken to that link instead of collapsing the comment. Case in point: the automod comment at the top of every thread in r/politics. Instead of collapsing, I get taken to their page about civility 75% of the time. It was actually quite frustrating sometimes having such a small target. 	human
1760	Thanks! I thought I had a bug	human
1761	Wait...but holding also collapses comments... you have to be really precise... and if you press a bit to strong on iPhone it just registers 3D touch.	human
1762	Oh my fucking god, my screen is cracked to shit(still works), and I thought it had finally gone out on me. Can a guy get a fucking warning over here? I was losing my mind.	human
1763	Eh, different devices work differently I guess, but in the past hour I've accidentally collapsed so many stacks, I've given up even trying to make it down past the first few comments. I'll be halfway through reading a comment and half the screen disappears, and I can't figure out what I've hit. Trying to un-collapse just leads to more comments vanishing. It's completely infuriating, to the point of just saying fuck it, I'll look at something else.  Maybe it's the way I scroll, I don't know. But I hate it. 	human
1764	Oh!  I like the new behavior a lot! But how was I supposed to learn about it?	human
1765	Apollo User Here   **M a k e  t h e  s w i t c h**	human
1766	Holy fuck this is annoying. 90% of the time I'm signed in but that 10% I just want to see a fresh reddit as it is in the wild without signing in on whatever borrowed device I am using, how is there no way to see reddit without either joining or getting a non-esc'able popup every time you open a link and want to go back. Fucking sucks. 	human
1767	If there’s one thing I’ve learned about reddit, it’s that nobody will ever be happy with a change to an app, whether it be big, small, functional, cosmetic, whatever. The solution is to keep developing the app, keep improving and adding and changing stuff, but at the end of the day put a “Revert To Original” slider in the settings and you’re all good. The people that don’t like change are happy and the people that like change are happy, so the devs can do anything they want without too much backlash. 	human
1768	If you pause the video it won't follow you. There's a preference to leave them paused by default that can help.   Alternatively, you can add the following as a CSS snippet in RES that will hide it when you scroll.      .pinnable-content.pinned { display: none; }	human
1769	It is probably more a matter of logistics.  As big as reddit is, it is probably housed on a cluster with CDN being used to distribute worldwide. This allows the main reddit to be faster depending by distributing the static content (and reddit has a lot) to multiple locations, rather then everyone connecting to a single location.    If single location was done, then it would result in slower speeds the further away you are from the server.  Using a CDN however allows you to keep content closer to the viewer.   There are only a percentage of reddits overall viewers who are using the alpha, so this isn't going to have the same resources behind it at the main reddit does.   Probably smaller cluster, if on a cluster at all, and not distributed into as many locations through the CDN. 	human
1770	Absolutely. [Here's](https://econsultancy.com/blog/10936-site-speed-case-studies-tips-and-tools-for-improving-your-conversion-rate) a pretty good collection of studies done on the impact of page load speed on abandonment and customer conversion rates, and Google did a study on the impact of continued use over time for a permanent or temporary slowdown.  Short version:  * 7% loss in customer conversion for every 1 second increase (for shopping sites) * 16% loss in continued use of the site * 100-400ms delay in Google search results caused 0.2-0.6s reduction in searches per user. Impact worsened the longer the experiment went	human
1771	This sounds more like a Chrome bug instead of a Reddit bug. Reddit simply requests that Chrome sends you a notification, but from there on it's in Chrome's hands and it decides where the notification displays.	human
1772	"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:  - [/r/beta] [\[Feedback\] ""Welcome to reddit"" popup ALL the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/comments/81d6oc/feedback_welcome_to_reddit_popup_all_the_time/)  &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*"	human
1773	Use of a CDN wasn't added with the redesign, though, so the CDN being the root cause of a slower alpha experience is likely a specious explanation. It's plausible, but I don't think it's the likely culprit.   I'd wager the issue is more on the side of poorly optimized Javascript running concurrently/asynchronously to load content into widgets that weren't necessary to convert to asynchronous widgets in the first place. That kind of design is great when you want to prioritize which content loads first so that you can get the info on to the page and get people browsing, but in its current state it doesn't look like that's working as one would expect.   I'm sure they'll improve it over time but I hope they delay the launch until page loads on the new design at least have parity with the current design. 	human
1774	Not a bug. Subreddit owners can disable that feature	human
1775	Don't expect them to fix that, as that stuff is just a temporary measure until the site-wide redesign.	human
1776	It's because of the word-break css they're using.      word-break: break-all;     word-break: break-word;  Browsers use the last valid property they come across, which for blink/webkit is the `break-word` line, and other it's `break-all`.  [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=word-break) states:  &gt;Chrome, Safari and other WebKit/Blink browsers also support the unofficial break-word value which is treated like word-wrap: break-word.  The [compatibility table on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/word-break#Browser_compatibility) confirms that IE and Firefox do not support `break-word`.  Here are a couple of stackoverflow questions on the subject: [one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795109/what-is-the-difference-between-word-break-break-all-versus-word-wrap-break), [two](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34532242/how-to-mimic-word-break-break-word-for-ie9-ie11-and-firefox).	human
1777	The differences this would present would largely be measured in fractions of a second though. CDN distribution makes a performance gain, but not *that* big of a performance gain. A CDN is also only used for the first request -- after that, everything is cached, and followup requests will read from the cache. The request to the server itself is going to take a big hunk of time, and then executing any relevant JS will take up the bulk of the rest	human
1778	That's a quite nice design. Which font are you using there?	human
1779	A 64 bit int underflow in the wild!	human
1780	Yeah, that's a negative number.	human

1873	https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/amp/2017/08/13/whats-a-safe-amount-of-weight-to-lose-in-a-week_a_23074202/  A bit too fast leh. Don't think you can poop 3kg worth of product. When I worked in f&amp;b for 2 months I only lost 1kg from being on my feet all day (but no diet change)	human
1874	...?! that's a bit too fast and a little worrying... were you overeating before this or are you undereating now? Tabata is high intensity interval training? I just googled	human
1875	Yeah but confession though :/ if op's friend is young then I can understand doing it through text. At any age and via any means confession always takes courage, esp first few times. It's one thing to get told the rejection, it's another to have no response at all. Damn.	human
1876	http://www.shebakeshere.com/2014/04/easy-yogurt-overnight-oats.html  never tried this but apparently I have it bookmarked. This one is yoghurt instead of milk	human
1877	Next step exercise :p how long did it take for you to lose the 3kg?	human
1878	Ouch! :(	human
1879	Not an audiophile so not sure about that. If Stereo doesn't have the headphones you want, you could go check out Jaben @ The Adelphi. It's within walking distance from City Hall mrt. I just recommended Stereo first because of the convenience since you're a tourist	human
1880	that reminds me i used to match my twitter username with my display pic in sec sch lolololol	human
1881	Lololol it's more for me to keep track of when the next period will come	human
1882	too empty for me but ok since it works for you. funny how the wallpaper doesnt match the app icon aesthetic though	human
1883	Stereo in Plaza Singapura. It's near Dhoby Ghaut mrt	human
1884	Oh WTF your home screen was so empty I completely missed those two icons on top. that's just extreme man	human
1885	The close friend would confide in him a lot of things, and even cry on skype call. He got quite protective of her so I got very jealous. And then got other stuff that would be too personal to share on this public platform out of respect for him so can't really say.   Basically it's playing the pity card thing. I got the feeling that she was trying to get his attention. As long as you don't give off that feeling anything will be ok.	human
1886	context matters a lot. My bf has a female best friend that I am ok with (maybe it also helped that I also know her). He also had a close female friend that I was not ok with. They had very differing convo topics and the 2nd girl was uh... kinda suspicious i guess... despite having a bf. 	human
1887	you sent the wallpaper only never send with the apps	human
1888	i have 4 homescreen pages bro that's the most cluttered page i sent	human
1889	Yeah i hate it when mine is all over the place	human

1891	https://imgur.com/a/VjKkV  I don't really care if insta people recognize me i guess	human
1892	Then people from insta will recognize the pic because I posted it there before and know it's me *GASP* then gotta use more emojis to censor the whole thing 	human

1900	I'll just get my baileys. Talk so much here but don't drink anything in the end will be wasted lol	human
1901	I want to do that but I think my mum will nag each time I open a can though	human
1902	Yeah it is, but I kinda want that comfort drink feeling. Beer does it for me, as well as baileys with milk. Coffee is definitely out of the question s:	human
1903	I don't want to drink Baileys straight though :( I don't even have milk to go with it!	human

1913	I'm attached in the first place and u/mundey knows I got beef with him lol	human
1914	Only got Baileys and Kahlua here	human

1989	They could somehow modify the amount of $ in their account and use it to buy rubies 	human
1990	Social etiquette though. Some things you just keep to yourself. It would be rude to just go up to a random girl on the street and tell them you like their butt. It's unsolicited flirting, sexual flirting idk, which is usually not appreciated (unless you're really handsome I guess)	human
1991	1. youre fit 2. good results	human
1992	Because those people who say that associate ordinary people with lesbian porn :/ They just want to see girls making out because it's hot to them. At risk of sounding like an sjw, that's just sexualizing them so it's extremely disrespectful.	human
1993	I'm bi myself. If someone said that to me based on my sexuality I would tear into them.  It seemed like you're saying she's hot just because she's bi, which I hope was not the case. It sounds like those people telling two lesbians to make out just because seeing 2 girls make out is hot to them.   But based on your explanation, it seems like that was not your intention.	human
1994	Lol I don't even know how to respond to that	human

1996	Bro that's not how sexuality works  Also please don't call people hot just based on their sexuality. That's fucking disrespectful. 	human

2037	I agree with your friend. Poly is the time to try out all the things you couldn't do in sec school. Stick with one by the time you reach y2. You may not even have the time to keep going back for that one you chose and that's fine. CCA isn't compulsory. I'm just all for trying out things at least once	human
2038	Just a realistic tip though, most of the time love and loyalty is not enough. Communication, having the same core values, basic hobbies/interests are plenty important too	human
2039	Okay. You've managed to get 2 people to like you back. You'll definitely be able to get more in the future because you're already doing something right.	human

2051	Greetings, Raiders This is King’s Raid Dev. Team. Now it’s already the end of February. Also, Spring is right in front of us. We hope you have a fresh start on March!  [Play Revamps]  The main purpose of the 4th Game Play Revamp is to assist all Raiders to level up until  certain grades and levels much faster and much more conveniently.   First of all, we are currently developing a new Attendance Check Board, that can replace  ‘5 Days Attendance’ and ‘7 Days Attendance’ boards. Through the revamped attendance board,  you will be able to play the early stage of the game much faster and by far more conveniently  than before.  The revamped Attendance Check Board will provide you with lots of helpful items every day  such as heroes, items for hero’s growth, and Unique Weapon and this will help you enjoy  more until the last day of attendance.  Second, we are going to add [HELP] menu that you can get various information in the game. Currently, you only have a glimpse of game functions through early game tutorials.  If you skip the tutorials (Intentionally or not), there was no more chance for you  to know those information again.  Plus, some functions didn’t even have detailed information that you wouldn’t know  if you had skipped tutorials.   From now on, we are going to add [HELP] menu, so that you can search any information any time.  [Balance Patch]  There will be 2 main parts of Balance Patch this time.   First, we are going to balance some heroes and items that are extremely good in PvP.  Some heroes and items were meant to be effective at the same time especially in PvP.  However, these are actually dominating throughout the PvP mode. So, we are going to make some balance patches to reduce specific skills and item effects that  can dominate the battle, and make other ways to do it instead.  Second, we are going to buff heroes who are weak compared to others.   We are aware that sometimes Pure Dealers actually record much less DPS than CC Dealers.  We will keep monitoring these heroes for further balance patch. We are also monitoring other issues for the further balance patches. As we mentioned via Patch Note on 2nd February, our agenda is to optimize the balance  bit by bit in along term, rather than hurrying to make a huge change at once like our old agenda.    [NPC Hero Recruit System Revamp]  NPC Hero Recruit System was quite controversial for months and now the time for  the revamp has come closer.  A lot of users couldn’t even think about getting an NPC hero because of its tiring requirements.   Until now, we had only 2 ways:  1) To purchase NPC Present Box and collect Friendship Points.  2) To collect total 18 million Raid Points (Let’s assume you are grinding the Raid items  you have so far) and purchase T3 Legendary Items from the Forge Shop, grind them all, and craft presents for the Friendship Points. So called T3 Item Farming.  NPC Hero Recruit System was designed to give motivation to high level raiders. However,  unlike our plan, raiders had to play the raids for T3 item farming which we thought quite meaningless.   As a matter of fact, the 2nd method is pretty hard unless you are one of the top level of players.  (In the beginning phase of development, there was an outlook that this could possibly fail  to motivate players.  And… To be honest, it was just extremely hard… (Yes… I also got Gladi this way.. lol)  To break the wall, we are going to make adjustments on NPC Recruit System as below.  First, we are going to reduce the amount of Rubies you need for recruiting an NPC hero at once.  The reason why we are reducing the required Rubies is simple.  1) If a hero has lower performance compared to the price, people prefer less: May 2) If a hero has quite a good performance compared to the price, people prefer more: Gladi  (Honestly, May is not that bad for a healer. However, we admit there are much better healers  with better skills, compared to the cost to get.)  It might cause balance issues with other heroes when we add more NPC heroes  in the future patches.   So, reducing the Ruby cost is one of the solutions.  Since the ruby cost is very expensive, people barely can try the first method.   To solve these issues, we are going to reduce the cost of Rubies to acquire NPC heroes  and Unique Weapons right away.  In addition, we will try removing T3 Item Farming method. After the revamp,  everyone will be able to recruit NPC heroes if they try hard enough.  We are going to sell some amounts of Friendship Items in Raid Shop much cheaper.  There will be two types of items. Even lower level users will be able to target NPC heroes  and Unique Weapons.  For those who have been farming T3 items, they will be able to collect more Friendship Points  compared to invested time.   Plus, there will be a balance patch on NPC heroes. As we are going to lower the wall of recruiting,  we are also going to do some adjustments on the balance.  This is to set the balance standards for to-be-announced heroes for the future.  Along with NPC Hero Recruit System revamp, we have noticed that high level users may feel  their motivation faded. (I felt that my own playtime would be shortened much.)  So, all members in development team had to think over and over about covering this,  and came to conclusion as below.   [Enchant Scroll &amp; Hard Solo Dragon Raid Mode]  As mentioned above, T3 item farming will be removed. So, we had to go through  a lot of discussions to come up with the content which can be replaced to provoke  players’ motivation.  So, what is the reason you do T3 item farming? It was to obtain Gladi and his Unique Weapon to become more powerful.  Since T3 item farming will be gone with the revamp, more time and effort are inevitable  to get an NPC hero and Unique Weapon. What would be the final content in hero’s growth in the game so far?  The answer is upgrading by the use of Legendary Enchant Scrolls. Currently, there is no way to acquire Legendary Enchant Scrolls other than from  the Weekly Raid Quest or Limited Sales Event. And it has helped slow down  the speed of further hero growth.   Mainly, there will be two revamps as below.  1) Lv.75 or higher level Dragon Raid: A dragon will drop Enchant Scrolls up to Ancient class. 2) Hard Dragon Raids: A dragon will drop up to Legendary Enchant Scrolls max. -&gt; With this revamp, you don’t have to focus only on Raid Points.  Just clearing dragon raids will motivate you as well.  In addition, there will be a new content, which is ‘Hard Dragon Raid Solo’.   In this content, you will be able to set your deck of 8 heroes to hunt down a dragon,  just like World Boss battle. (Since it’s a Solo mode, difficulty will be set accordingly) Upon clearing Hard Dragon Raid Solo, you will be able to obtain Enchant Scroll up to  Legendary class.  Drop rate will be lower than Hard Dragon Raid, but the good thing is,  you can play Solo Raid whenever you want to play in AUTO mode,  if your heroes are powerful enough.  We are also preparing a function which will enable you to upgrade Enchant Scrolls  by using inferior Enchant Scrolls and some Dragon Scales.  Have you collected enough Dragon Scales? This will be the perfect chance for you to use them!  Lastly, Enchant Scrolls will be given to all party members just like Raid Points,  so you don’t have to bid the scrolls.  [Special Shop Revamp]  Another good news!  Special Shop will be revamped. You will be able to check and purchase items displayed assortatively which will ease your shopping.  Plus, there will be two changes on Mileage Points.  1) Items that can be purchased with Cash: Lua’s Token will be given upon purchasing cash items. 2) Items that can be purchased with Ruby: Mileage Points will be given upon purchasing Ruby items.  A lot of people were hesitating to purchase some items because some of them did not include  Mileage Points. However, after the revamp, you don’t have to worry about it.   We will add some more benefits on Cash Items as well. Lua’s Token is the 2nd Mileage Points. So, that means there will be also items you can purchase  by using Lua’s Tokens.  Along with Special Shop revamp, we will add ‘Class Unique Weapon’ in Special Item Summon. Even if you don’t have hero’s Unique Weapon, you will be able to use this ‘Class Unique Weapon’  for specific class heroes. Since all class heroes can share the weapon,  the weapon’s performance itself will be lower than casual Unique Weapon,  but it will be a lot easier to acquire.  When Class Unique Weapons are added, some Unique Weapons that rely on the Rune equipment  may have less value than the ones having strong stats. (Like Priest / Knight).  Thank you for reading a long Green Note. We will always try our best to come up with best ideas for better game service.  Thank you King’s Raid Development Team.	human

2059	Yeah. So much hype but I had to find their website from another site	human
2060	Not sure about that. Didn't really read the articles and it's been years	human
2061	Yes I think. Such cases appeared in the news a number of times	human
2062	https://www.3dollarballer.com/  Their website. Tried googling and can't believe I couldn't find their website on the results. Found it eventually from mustsharenews	human
2063	I won't be going haha but thanks for the offer!	human
2064	eeyerr	human
2065	!redditsilver  now youre free to go!	human
2066	i rate that 0/10	human
2067	I've only ever met online friends that I've known for about 10 years. So we practically grew up together	human
2068	Common mistakes:   1. Not checking blind spots 2. Not stopping completely at stop line (even after stopping, have to show that you are checking out for cars instead of just stopping for &lt;1s before moving off) 3. Striking curb, mounting curb in parking + narrow courses (both can be countered by reversing to adjust your position. First correction is free, subsequent ones are 2pts each. Better than one shot 10pts or immediate fail)  That's what I can remember	human
2069	Americans man. Can't find the steak post anymore but I'm subscribed to it and have seen a few on my front page :/	human
2070	Have you seen r/ramen? People actually do that	human
2071	Grew up in the era with the mindset of not meeting strangers on the internet :P	human
2072	1k comments at 2pm already. Very nice. Probably can break ytd's 1.5k by 12am record	human
2073	No go for me but thanks	human
2074	"Eh idk this a_woman_with_pen thing you and /u/_solasura reacted very strongly when I mentioned ""aka your wife"" and I'm not sure why"	human
2075	I'm a bit confused here. Or is it that you'd rather me not bring your wife into this	human
2076	Weren't people encouraged to wear other races' traditional clothing in primary school? Woah times have changed...........	human
2077	Wait am I missing something? /u/a_man_without_a_pen is married right???	human
2078	HAHAHAAHA I type out my reply already then they said comment was deleted. Delete damn fast sia  I was joking when I mentioned he could be birdebad and ... turns out he was	human
2079	I have no plans to meet a lot of people on here to be very honest	human
2080	aka your wife?	human
2081	Yeah, now I know the story already. Thought I tried to explain my opinion properly to you too	human
2082	u/birdebad TBH I have no idea how this became such a big thing. He was just another dude on the daily thread	human
2083	Quick someone make an account name a_woman_with_a_pen	human
2084	Lol did I sound that harsh? 	human
2085	I have no beef with you using Reddit as Tinder lol.   [Regarding this](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/80qld8/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/duy1keh/), I was not trying to burn you lololol I was [just stating it as a fact](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/80qld8/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/duy18vj/)  There is no story. I just called him out once on his prev acc, he made a new acc, I found out it was him again and that's it.	human
2086	Best is to be honest and break up before going for someone else lor. Lol I guess feeling guilty is a start.... Just don't do it again	human
2087	As females mature, nobody likes bad boys anymore just fyi	human
2088	Welp. Hope things get better for you	human
2089	"I see it as you respect your partner enough to not go for someone else while you're still together, so you break up before going for it.   Maybe a milder (and more hilarious) analogy would be you and your partner like meat. You both have a strong connection over meat. Then your partner goes overseas. While she's there you somehow suddenly start disliking meat and become vegan. Since you both have a strong connection over meat, you respect her and tell her your change in tastes. Maybe she will understand, maybe you will not, but you informed her. Rather than maybe letting her find out over Instagram or from a 3rd person that ""OMG you love meat right?! Your bf became a vegan!!!"" and then she's hurt that she has to find out that way instead of from you.   Does that make sense? Lol  For people who cheat with no intention of letting their partners know, that's just despicable and selfish. There's a special place in hell for them"	human
2090	I am. While my weird dreams give me something interesting to share, having dreams just make me wake up feeling not rested	human
2091	Is it cyber bullying if he admitted it himself	human
2092	Nope. He doesn't show the same form of respect to the manager.	human
2093	Then my opinion is that drunkedness is not an excuse. If you find the feelings fading then break it off before anything else	human
2094	Oh yup maturity and basic interests fit in the second	human
2095	When love is involved, seems like it	human
2096	I don't remember who though	human

2103	&gt; piss off certain ppl who think i reek of r/ihavesex  I lol'd. I remember this	human
2104	So much discussion on daily thread today. It's only lunchtime but I'm tired already lol	human

2106	Thanks!	human
2107	Yup! Eventually when he tides through it he will come out as a more mature person	human
2108	So in my company, I have connections with the boss which is how I got this job. I'm also very young. It's very odd to see this other consultant, who is almost old enough to be my dad and also respects my boss a lot, try to get on my good side and treat me like a boss....... It's very odd...........	human
2109	!redditsilver	human
2110	Got people talk about sex?? Did I miss that discussion?	human
2111	I hope you don't actually think that way lol, girls who like bad boys are stuck in a 12y/o mentality	human
2112	You need to turn that 5 into 100. Lunch time liao not gonna raid	human
2113	RIP in advance	human
2114	Thanks! :)	human
2115	"Disclaimer: I am just 1 among the sea of females, others may have different opinions from me.  I personally have 2 ""checklists"" - 1 for getting me to like them, 1 for deciding if they're right for me to get into a relationship with.  1st: My type is funny, smart, nice, and they stand out. If they fit this and I start to like them, I will want to get to know them better and start internally assessing the next step.  2nd: Do we have a compatible sense of humour? Do they have basic respect for others? Do we have the same core values? Do they have strengths in the areas I'm weaker at and vice versa (ie completing each other, cliche as it sounds)? Etc  If they fit the bill for all 3 (and like me back) then we'll get together. If they don't like me back or don't fit the 2nd then it just ends here.  "	human
2116	Yup. I am	human
2117	HAHAHA I'd say he's just in honeymoon period. Eventually he won't feel the need to talk 24/7 already	human

2119	Youth 1 because gonna be separated for uni :/	human
2120	"""nice guys"" are assholes, in case you haven't understood that yet lol"	human
2121	Hahahahaha I know what you mean.	human
2122	Lol you'd be surprised.......	human
2123	Are you falling apart to half time	human
2124	Both of us entered the relationship with the intention of marriage after all :P	human
2125	Ikr :( Thanks!	human
2126	Oh yeah sounds like he's projecting his own insecurities. 	human
2127	"I am seriously flabbergasted by all the reactions defending the points you listed.  For people saying 1-3 is normal for genuinely nice guys, I'm going to say it's true for genuinely PASSIVE guys if you look at each point as separate points. **You can be nice without being passive.**   What OP means is to look at the whole list as a package. Tip for you all, being overly passive is not attractive unless you're a masochist and want your gf to step all over you.  They apply to people who want the girl to think they're good for them by always agreeing with the girl, ""romantically"" putting the girl first, like in dramas. They want to sweep the girl off her feet by following a checklist. Sure, it's polite to not offend people. But to the point of not even voicing a disagreement? Yeeesh. **They're just trying to pretend to be someone they're not.** That will not work out in all scenarios. **It is not romantic.** They just want to get a girlfriend, instead of getting to know the girl as a person.   So after following their imaginary checklist, point 4 comes in. They think they've done everything right, did so much for the girl by being 'nice', so the girl must have fallen for them by now, right?  Wrong. I'm sure most of you can recognize point 4 as the textbook definition of a nice guy. Then they get mad that their effort in being 'nice' has been wasted and their true colours show.  OP has addressed pt5 here already:  https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/80qld8/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/duxwuag/  I guess you can always just say ""Why can't the girl just reject him?"" and I would agree so I don't really have anything to say about pt5 lol sorry for the anticlimatic ending"	human
2128	"No4 is textbook definition of a ""nice guy"". They feel like they deserve the girl just because they were ""nice""."	human
2129	"Wtf I'd fucking smack him. So insolent. Look them in the eye and say ""I'm the one who got a girlfriend"" and do a sassy hair flip and sashay off"	human
2130	Thanks you too man	human
2131	I guess so. I was thinking of moving in together without the marriage aspect (would be kinda tough in SG I think), but if op is really young then moving in together wouldn't be an issue yet	human
2132	Personal experience, still always easier to get Uber to accept my bookings than Grab, so I guess their method works better. (or there are other factors like incentives or something)	human
2133	Alright I understand!	human
2134	Omg hahahah so coincidental	human
2135	Have our first ever overseas holiday! Then it's off to overseas uni for me S:	human
2136	Ah I see. I don't mean to pry and it's none of my business so you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but wouldn't you be living with your SO in the future? You'll be going home to them everyday.	human

2144	Ahhhhhhhh I meant on the weekly thread, not as a new thread xD Your post is gonna get removed!	human
2145	Np :)	human
2146	Oh yeah that's true. I've received gift cards from relatives but they're relatives so I didn't think much of it. Might be kinda weird to receive that from friends	human
2147	Oh just saw your reply here lol disregard my other reply then. This just makes my other reply useless	human
2148	You monster!	human
2149	Hello! I suggest looking at the IT courses. The web dev scene in SG is not very big I think. I think most places also require you to be able to do back-end because honestly, it's much easier to learn front-end than back-end. I supposed to join a web dev company for internship, but they withdrew last minute due to the lack of projects :/ 	human
2150	Ohh. Not sure about the Boat Quay one. You could try checking out the non burger bar outlets! I've been to the Marina Square one and as far as I recall, the only difference is the convenience of buying a build-your-own. The one near Plaza Sing is a non burger bar outlet, but their menu has a build-your-own section too.	human
2151	Hmmm, I used Luna without her UW for quite a long time. She might be a quick and dirty solution to helping you with Ch6. Artemia would be better of course but I don't know how she fares without UW. Maybe you could ask a new question on this thread to compare the various MDMG dealers with and without their UWs	human
2152	Tbh I don't recommend giving cosmetics because certain shades (lipstick) don't suit certain skin tone, some people have sensitive skin etc. Gift cards from those shops would be better I think, but people have suggested that already	human
2153	Fat Boy's burger bar? They're a chain. They have outlets in other places.  https://www.fatboys.sg/	human

2167	Which part of Ch6 are you stuck at? Ch6 has low MDEF.   I'll answer your questions based on the heroes I have, maybe someone else can chip in to fill in the info I'm lacking.   1. Annette is not a main dps. She amps I think. She needs to be T5 to be good, from what I read around here. I personally only have her at T1. At that time I couldn't afford the resources to build her to T5 so I benched her. Luna is pretty good.   2. I don't know how good Rodina is as a dps because I don't have her, but Nyx became my main dps after I got him. But that's also because he's my first T5. I got Nyx for PVP though. He's pretty good there. For mobs weak to MDMG, My T3 Luna does better dps than Nyx (eg Ch6 hell Conquest, WB1). Also Nyx needs his UW. You can build him if you have the patience, but it might take a long time since you're stuck at ch6. Mediana is PDMG just fyi.  3. MDMG heroes are strong in WB1. My T3 0* Luna does 6mil dps while T5 1* UW Nyx does 2mil dps. T5 0* Pavel does about 2.5mil dps. Gau might be good for bringing down the CC bar, then Pavel can just do his thing while WB1's core is exposed.  4. I built Pavel because icy blue pretty boy lol. I use him when I need that extra CC because I didn't build Gau. But you're building Gau so I'd say Gau is better for the CC. Pavel isn't quite main dps material so if you're focusing on dps, Pavel is not the hero to go for. He does pretty decent dmg as a subdps though. I don't really know the other benefits of Pavel so maybe someone else can help me out here.  5. Didn't build Gau so can't answer that	human
2168	Username checks out.... maybe...?	human
2169	Dk if you missed it but he got his fwb pregnant then paid for the abortion. At least he took responsibility so he's got that going for him	human
2170	You have a lesson duration, so technically there is a time limit lol.  Anyway for the test itself, you'll get demerits if you go over the time limit for doing parking. Can't rmb the timing, might be 3min and 5min. I think that's the only one with a time limit in the test. The rest would be based on your mistakes made.  For lessons, it's at your instructor's discretion, really. If you're good, you'll spend less time going over the same thing. But if you get a slack instructor, he might just clear you for the content even though you're not that good at it yet. You can request your instructor to let you practice more though.  I had lessons with CDC. The curriculum was split into 3 phases. 1st phase had a few beginning sessions in the circuit and then the rest was on the road. 2nd phase was learning 3 point turn, slope etc so it was mostly in circuit. Forgot if parking is in 2nd or 3rd phase. 3rd phase is most of the preparation for test. After I completed the curriculum, the remainder of the lessons was just going 1 round around circuit and 1 (out of 12) test routes.  The number of lessons you'll require before the test greatly varies between each student. You'll see some redditors say they took less than 20, some more than 20. I myself took 29, but I passed on first try. I also did at CDC Kovan, so every lesson had 20min spent on the road travelling to and from the circuit at CDC Ubi, that's why I took longer as well.	human
2171	There's a neighbourhood cat (collared) who sometimes runs into my area, stops, stares at me, meows. When I start to walk towards it, it runs away. Then it stops and stares at me intently again :/	human
2172	*gasp*	human
2173	aaaaaaaaah cute boye	human
2174	*i have a boyfriend*	human
2175	I send my bf funny or cute stuff I come across on reddit throughout the day. Usually I'll tell him stuff that happens but work days are pretty mundane	human
2176	I just have to say, he's thirsty as hell but I dont think he resorted to being creepy like that. Might have been someone else	human
2177	LOL	human
2178	City hands down. The only thing I appreciate about nature is the sky. Everything else is not my thing	human
2179	No wonder, I thought it was strange the comment points jump so much from late last night and this morning lol	human
2180	Lol, as much as I have something against his original acc, I don't think he resorted to doing that. Might've been someone else	human
2181	https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7x4gmv/_/du5umfa	human
2182	Lol are you serious? If you are then I take all my civil words back. I don't take kindly to cheaters.	human
2183	Well it was birdebad before this but he deleted his acc. Unless you're his new acc....	human
2184	it's not very interesting lol. that one time another redditor accused me, a female, of being jealous of another person having a big dick was more interesting	human
2185	Oh I meant you just saying hi to OP when she said why can't she attract non psychos. Yes, you may not see it that way, but to us even this simple act comes across as thirsty. It's the context.  Alright then. I understand. Case closed :)	human
2186	I guess I could've phrased it better. I was genuinely trying to help in areas that I can see, which is just from your reddit comments in the daily threads.  All I'm trying to say is, you've mentioned you're trying to get dates on reddit. That's fine. But you're also coming across as thirsty on reddit which is counterproductive, which is what I'm trying to point out to you. You may not see yourself as being thirsty, but girls can tell very well. I am not trying to make a personal attack.  &gt; If it's not directed at you or anyone else here  It was directed at op wasnt it?  &gt;  clearly you didn't bother to find out what had gone wrong in my life  I don't even know what you're trying to say with this or how you even came up with that. I was just trying to tell you why you came across as thirsty. I'm not here to help you fix your life. I'm not trying to start any arguments either, but it seems like our discussion is headed in that direction.	human
2187	fat	human
2188	You are free to say whatever you want, but the general consensus would be that the less you talk about trying to score dates, the less thirsty you would seem, thus increasing your chances of getting someone interested in you, since you mentioned you're trying on reddit out of convenience. Like you said, there are negative connotations of being seen as thirsty. Appearing thirsty is really unattractive so you might want to seriously consider how you act online.	human
2189	.......omg	human
2190	Tbh you made a lot of posts here about dating and stuff so.. to 3rd person pov yes, you sound thirsty. PMing every girl here is just creepy. Thirsty and creepy aren't synonymous	human
2191	Hmmm the voice kinda reminds me of Yousei Teikoku. Not sure if the style is what you would like though	human
2192	Yeah, edited my comment to mention the first one	human

2196	Hmmm CS might be pretty tough though! Pay is important but I hope you'll choose something that you have interest in too	human
2197	Not that open. The only online friends I've ever met were after I've known them for about 10 years	human

2204	There was a jrock mv in the recommended vids at the side of that cover, now that sent me on a jrock binge	human
2205	If you two are still interested in each other, looks arent everything :P when the feelings come you'll be 10/10 to each other eventually	human

2249	I know haha don't worry! I think you're a really nice person for seeing past all that	human
2250	10/10	human
2251	Hahaha ps I'm not a guy and I'm also attached. This was just a funny discussion	human
2252	It was a rhetorical joke question	human
2253	Thank you! You too	human
2254	OP pls revert	human
2255	Gimme that then I can 2* UW my 5* Ophelia	human
2256	&gt; shy, nerdy, cute guys  Do they fulfill the cute aspect	human
2257	Thanks for your advice and for listening :) I'll see what I can do	human
2258	I worked as a barista for a brand that I loved and also thought it was really interesting. Coffee making was fun and all but I quit real quick because the colleagues were terrible. Ugh ruined all my love for that brand too	human
2259	Is every article Premium now	human
2260	Thanks man. I just feel so unsatisfied but I don't know how to settle the other aspects if I quit. Oh well	human
2261	Yo just gonna, uh rant, a bit here.   I'm taking a gap year before entering uni later this year. Due to circumstances I have my current job forced on me. It's not anywhere near my field of interest. Which is why I reddit so often lol. I'm just going on day by day, but maybe I have it a bit easier since I have an out which is going to uni. I'm pretty much just staying on for money, pretty sweet considering it's my first FT job. But it's also not that easy to quit due to same circumstances that forced the job on me in the first place. I'm not hard on finances, it's just a motivation lol. It's kind of easy money, it's really laidback and I have little supervision.  Now it's a bit too late to look for a different temp job in my diploma's sector. Preparation for uni is probably not until June/Aug (depending on which uni) so if I quit soon I will have months in between with no plans other than the random stuff I wanted to do. Aug would be 6 months which seems sufficient for an internship or so right, but I do want some months to myself to relax and do things which was what the whole gap year was for in the first place. But this job was fkin forced on me. I'll pm for details if you're interested to know the actual circumstances :/ I just really dunno what to do with my life right now	human
2262	Oh shit!! Edited. Thanks!	human
2263	Really? I don't know anyone with experience with this so you may be right. /u/ad_nawseum are you seeing this? Haha.	human
2264	Alright 	human
2265	I'm team Onodera and mad that she never stood a chance despite the mutual liking in childhood and all throughout middle school	human
2266	OP will have something else to grind	human
2267	This is way better than Nisekoi man they're not even worth comparing	human
2268	Yup, I agree, a good shot at other good US universities, just probably not the cream of the crop	human
2269	Edited my comment, not sure if you saw that part.  There are still plenty of other good unis in the US though. You don't necessarily have to aim for top of the top. You might stand a better chance with those unis	human
2270	B in Math, sorry I don't think that is going to land you a spot in those top unis. They pretty much require perfection. My bro got into an ivy league (that isn't one of the 3 you mentioned btw) for engineering and he has overall perfect grades for the required subjects with a lot of academic achievements in those said areas. You'd stand a better chance applying for NUS. Grats on your good results though!	human
2271	Ahhh I see. I don't know anything about sewing so maybe that's why it seems better to me. Also I'm female so, well, female clothes. In terms of quality I haven't had any problems with them.   I had a blouse which I bought for internship and wore it once a week, every week for the whole 6 months and I didn't observe any noticeable decrease in quality. It was a nice amount of stretchyness for a tight blouse and also thick enough to not be see-through, which is a lot more than I can say for female clothing nowadays. Yeeeesh. Even BLACK blouses now are see-through.	human
2272	&gt;  John, a student, steps out from his waterfront Punggol North flat and onto his personal mobility device, before zipping along a lush, green trail to his school, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).  Better hope that lush, green trail isn't a pedestrian path.   Also this entire snippet reads like a primary school model essay what the fuck	human

2293	Oh yikes. I think there's hostel-style accomodation called Matchbox, just a suggestion if it ever comes down to you living on your own. I've never tried it before though but it seems decent. I wish you all the best man :/	human
2294	Sapporo maybe? I consider it a cheaper version of Asahi	human
2295	Wooo nice thanks for this! I was unaware	human
2296	Hold up uh where are you all gonna stay? I feel like that's the most pressing concern at the moment	human

2308	&gt; life’s destination is always death  LOL  Thanks :) 	human
2309	I'm not jealous of his accomplishments but I'm jealous that my parents hold him in high regard in all areas just because of his achievements, ignoring his shortcomings in areas that are not his strength, thus disregarding my strengths as well.  My parents never compared us actually so I didn't lose any confidence from sibling competition. But my parents liked to compare me with my friends, especially the overachievers like my brother. THAT caused a lack of self esteem.	human
2310	Yes I'm Chinese. It's not that, my bro has super good results, won many awards, even managed to snag a scholarship to study overseas. I have literally nothing S: the only thing I have and he doesn't is I did piano all the way to Grade 8 and he didn't.	human
2311	Haha okay	human
2312	My game gets stuck on loading when I do BD with my friends. Sometimes another friend gets stuck, sometimes it's only me and the other 2 can do the run fine.	human
2313	My bf is not the kind to lie about such things.	human
2314	Arranged to meet my bf at Citylink's Smiggle. If you've been there you know it's not really that big at all. I was inside, didn't move much, at most from behind the pillar to no longer behind the pillar. My bf went in, walked around the entire shop including behind the pillar and didn't see me at all. That was kinda freaky. I didn't even leave the shop at all.	human
2315	Cold Brew	human
2316	I've tried it before. It was super weird. Like what's this coffee doing in my lemonade	human
2317	Was gonna say no but now that I think about it it's true.	human
2318	Time for my I-survived-until-Friday Starbucks treat	human
2319	...I hope things will get better for you eventually :/ That doesn't sound too good	human
2320	&gt; you must understand both female point of view, you drink it you are safe. you drink it and tell your gf later to tell her mum not to make cause its disgusting, you be in trouble. Not fair? yeah! thats how it is if you wanna have a healthy relationship.  Uh. Nope. That just honestly screams unhealthy relationship. Healthy relationship needs communication. But if I recall correctly you are married so I guess that works for you? I don't think this method works very well in OP's case. I'd say he did right by telling his gf to tell her mum instead, because she knows her mum best and knows how to tell her things without hurting her feelings.  In OP's case, he could have phrased it more politely in his message, but I'd say his gf also did not respect his wishes by refusing to help him convey it to his mum. It does not help both parties by choosing to stay quiet. The TCM drink could be better used on someone else who would appreciate it better.	human
2321	"5 years. When I was a kid I thought it was good because big bro can protect me (which he did when we were kids and I am eternally grateful)!   As I grew older I realized it's not so good. Additionally he's the star of the family so I'm always in his shadow, my parents will never stop seeing me as the immature one because of his extra 5 years of maturity despite multiple instances of me having better opinions in certain areas. When it comes to decision making, my bro and I have different priorities (because surprise, we're different people with different personalities) but my parents always side with him.  Not hating on my bro, just super miffed that despite my parents recognizing that in those instances, they forget it all again afterwards just because.   I do get along pretty well with my bro though. I confide in him regarding family matters but nothing else.  Maybe it has nothing to do with the age gap but more because he's the golden child, but my bro has definitely said the ""I have more years of experience than you"" line before lol"	human
2322	Nisekoi	human
2323	Lol I got a little angry reading that. Does your friend not ask before taking?!	human
2324	Ugh they comment until like that fucking creeps she just wanted hair advice	human

2326	Wth did you guys do until she go delete comment	human

2328	Used to put on hives when I was a kid. Just dab on the itchy spot	human
2329	I didn't realize it but that's exactly what happened with my bf and me LOL. Wait until after exams to decide, just nice 2 weeks	human
2330	Well I had a study session with my (then-not-yet) bf and he started petting my head, I put my hand on his and then he held my hand without thinking. Look where we ended up	human

2334	Omg hahahha ok speaking as same gender experience, I agree with u/donthavela that it's a possibility  On the other hand, op's crush could be flirting with her :-)	human
2335	Wow it worked. Now no hissy fits will be had	human
2336	No specific example I can think of at the moment, but when their grammar and vocab is so poor that you don't understand what they're saying and they look at you as though you're the idiot. So frustrating	human
2337	I just had a craving for cheese fries!	human
2338	Mine never worked until I checked the settings and realized that despite selecting what I wanted notifications for, I didn't press the 'on' setting. Maybe you happened to miss it like me?	human
2339	Ahhh nice. Can't really tell the colour difference from the pic though. I hope you enjoyed yourself!	human
2340	Is there any chance that your employer browses Reddit lol plenty of IT people on Reddit	human
2341	I'm no lolicon! I'm into Pavel!	human
2342	&gt; 30 mins before maintenance ha.. haha.. FUCK  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA rip  Also I didn't think Viska (or as OP keeps calling Vodka) was waifu material.  What do you have against Lewi man she's cute and even better with that skin.  Everyone is better with that theme. Holy shit. Rodina's doesn't really look frozen though. Lakrak's is hilarious.	human
2343	Omg hahahahah that's super cute!	human
2344	His default is already Frozen themed so I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't get one actually	human

2349	Yeah I learnt my lesson after this	human
2350	I finished it, lettuce-mayo monstrosity and all. 	human
2351	Appetite is not what it used to be :'( guess I'll share with colleagues	human
2352	Northeast unfortunately. I guess I'll share with colleagues	human
2353	Lol so I bought KFC meal takeaway. Cashier even pointed on the menu on the counter to confirm I wanted the Shrooms Burger. I said yes.  Came back to find out I got the KFC version of a McChicken. Didn't even know KFC sold something like this.  That's not all. I wanted ala carte + cheese fries at first. Cashier was telling me meal add on cheese fries more worth so I said ok, expecting my fries to be changed to cheese fries with the top up cost. Top up is around same price as add on so I didn't think too much about it.   Came back and saw that I have standard fries AND cheese fries.  Omg lady what am I going to do with 2 packets of fries.	human
2354	Then I guess it's fine to just continue talking to her as friends like before. Don't text overly often, don't bring up romance too often. Arrange meeting up once in a while, with other friends if 1-1 makes her uncomfortable. But tbh if she doesn't want to meet you 1-1 then I would say you don't really have a chance :/  Maybe after some months you can try again, then if she rejects you again, give up and move on. Being too persistent is not good.	human
2355	I wouldn't recommend still trying to pursue after getting rejected but eh, you know her better than some stranger on the internet. What did she say? Like she doesn't see you that way, or not her type or something? Trying to figure out to see how you can continue approaching her, sorry if that's too sensitive to ask about	human
2356	tldr 10/10	human
2357	Text her normally like how you did before confessing	human
2358	&lt;Horimiya&gt;	human
2359	Only embarrassing if you have to confirm your purchase with the bank staff :P	human
2360	I mean, better than it being Tenga or something	human

2362	Np. Have fun!	human

2364	All the best! :)	human
2365	Ahhh too cute! I got a Pirate Acara Plushie today. It's on the TP, username: cerulean_cepheus if anyone is interested :P	human
2366	Looks super familiar. Maybe can find in NTUC?	human
2367	Nope. Lunch at a nice place. Been wanting to try there but their festive menus are always so expensive, so now is a good time with nothing festive going on	human
2368	Tried to search but couldn't find it. The gist of it was someone was hit by his teacher 20-30 years ago and wanted to report the teacher to the police now or something	human
2369	Thanks :D really looking forward to it!	human

2372	youre on a fucking roll today man	human
2373	Yeah telling it like it is	human
2374	I did with CDC, my instructor did a mock test with me on his own accord. Maybe you can make a request to your own instructor.  Warm up had just enough time to drive out from circuit's parking lot, go through every station 1 time then drive test route 1 time, then go back and get ready for actual test	human

2378	Dunno why her but here you go  u/Eaele	human
2379	Thank you :)	human
2380	Hmm maybe shoes weren't an issue in the past. My personal observation was an influx of affordable, lower quality shoes by brands such as H&amp;M, Cotton On etc. These shops are extremely accessible so people buy them more often now even though lower quality shoes have always existed. This isn't my area of expertise though so maybe it really isn't a factor.  If you were presenting it as facts then sure, it's acceptable. I suppose the way it was put across might have offended them. I wouldn't expect the men to get offended since that suggestion was for women.	human
2381	While I think that your initial guessing of gender was uncalled for, this is actually pretty interesting lol. Too long to properly read through though. I'm just gonna guess many women wear shoes that aren't that comfortable so more likely to walk less	human
2382	??	human
2383	It is like deja vu all over again.	human
2384	Yeah, can't even reply me asking why and he says you set the bar for idiocy	human

2391	No OT pay but compensate with shorter working hours/off day, depends	human
2392	Some light-ish/medium shade of brown. Their colour charts don't have colour names so it's just colour codes. It was on a particular chart that had 2 columns of brown, one with blue undertone and another with green undertone.  Oh, be sure to tell them if you have a sensitive scalp and they will apply scalp protector for you. I didn't know my scalp would be sensitive to their dye as I had dyed hair before with no effects but their dye made my scalp sting.   Their dyeing process was super quick btw. 10min and it can be rinsed off. I was expecting to sit there for the whole day but I was done in 2h (I also had a haircut).   You're doing it tomorrow? That's fast haha it's your birthday this month? You might have to make an appointment in advance though. I'm not sure how busy they will be but can't hurt to call and check!	human
2393	I've actually only ever been there once, which was for my birthday X: But that one time impressed me so much!  Tbh idk if it made a difference because I was there to dye hair, so idk if my hair felt any different after the dyeing stage and before the treatment stage since it was one shot do all. But it was free so.  Idk if it's one time either but I assume it is?	human
2394	Yup! I did Ultrasonic treatment. 	human
2395	It's cool, don't worry :) You do you too	human
2396	I don't play console games at all apart from Pokemon so pardon my lack of knowledge S:	human

2399	Can't remember if I watched the 2nd one hmm I'll look it up!	human
2400	Oh that's amazing! I thought it only supported Nintendo games	human
2401	"They have a few on their list for you to select. I think you can pick most of them, only a few are ""premium"" that you can't pick (or have to top up, can't remember). There was ultrasonic hair treatment, scalp treeatment, don't really remember the rest.   Also you become a member after your first visit then you can go back for free fringe cuts! They also provide complimentary beverages throughout your appointment so it's a nice bonus."	human
2402	I got as far as when the crows first appeared to attack you I think, which is super early on. FPS is really not my thing lol. I want to play it again but now my laptop cant handle the game anymore it gets too hot :(	human
2403	did you fry your brain from being sick	human
2404	Oh oh number76 gives free hair treatment during birthday month! I was pleasantly surprised with that when I went there for my birthday.	human
2405	Never too late to exercise :p	human
2406	Nothing much. Just hope to pass time quickly and end work :/	human
2407	Gonna piggyback on your comment and ask why the Switch over other consoles like 3DS? I don't really see the appeal so I'm curious	human
2408	Bioshock Infinite. I wanted to play it for rhe story but holy shit I sucked so bad and kept dying on Easy mode. Ended up watching the entire game on YouTube instead and the story is FUCKING AMAZING	human
2409	Doctor is fine isnt it? Or was that sarcasm that I missed	human
2410	...exactly. When I run LoH macro I have to alt tab away to not give my (Asian) parents a heart attack lol. Specifying Asian because conservative due to someone else pointing out that lewd is fine	human
2411	Haha didn't expect my offhand remark to spark such a discussion. Well like I just replied earlier, I'm from an Asian country and we're more conservative here so it's just not really socially acceptable. It's like openly reading ecchi in public	human
2412	I'm from an Asian country btw, we're more conservative here. If I were a male playing a game of bikini girls in public I'd be seen as a pervert	human
2413	Attendance was taken so most of us couldn't skip	human
2414	It was compulsory for us. Didn't really help us. Only told us stuff we already knew, a lot of common sense things. It was quite a waste of time	human
2415	My school liked to have bs enrichment courses like these. Nobody liked them	human
2416	Sounds great	human
2417	Congrats! My Exotic Fruits Pie (also new item from King Skarl) has been sitting in the tp untouched :(	human
2418	I-I just don't like his hairstyle!! And surprisingly I'm not very fond of any of the beach costumes. Females' are too lewd to play in public and I guess I'm not that into abs	human

2432	Omfg that pic. My friend's guildmate use atk, atk and mp recovery/atk runes for UW	human
2433	You're using t6 gears on him though, plus lack of gear stars. His atk is like 106k compared to your Nyx 149k.   I want to build Ophelia, no in fact I want to build way too many wizards :/	human
2434	I love them raw	human
2435	Yup exactly	human
2436	Never liked Eyries until I saw Faerie Eyrie. Got it on my (old) main until I zapped the hell out of it and now it's a cybunny. 	human
2437	And the devs are so generous!	human
2438	Yes that's where I do most of my gaming	human
2439	No idea. They just liked to one-up in the comments	human
2440	I stand by Kings Raid	human
2441	&gt; Then, the girls usually think 'he gave up so quickly because he doesn't like me much. He wouldn't give up if he likes a lot',  Addressing that this part is completely false. We don't think that way unless they're super immature I guess	human
2442	Pretty sure a lot of us don't view the number of attempts as sincerity. On the contrary, persistently pursuing her despite initial rejection shows a lack of respect for her own feelings.	human
2443	A lot of comments there mentioned how their country has this every year and gives a larger amount lol	human
2444	He's not SG citizen though, no subsidies and stuff	human
2445	He's LKY's son. With the bar set so high by LKY, naturally people compare. Either that or it's our current govt vs LKY too.	human
2446	In SG we're legally recognized as adults at 21	human
2447	Not sleepy for some reason ugh	human
2448	lose:  1. short 2. hair is too fine/thin + volume is very little 3. straight as a board both front and sideways (am female) 4. stubbornness runs in all members of the family so we can never have conducive arguments 5. bad at math, inherited from mum 6. not as smart as bro and dad, inherited from mum (not hating on my mum, but it's just really obvious) 7. procrastination apparently runs in the family, just in different areas 8. baby face + short + no curves = treated like a kid everywhere 9. mental issues run in the family from maternal side  win:  1. decent face I guess 2. had high metabolism in teenage years. i'm only in early 20s but metabolism slowed down a lot already. liked that I could eat practically anything during those years 3. good at picking up languages, inherited from mum 4. long eyelashes that females are vying for 5. i guess im not dumb? 6. physically generally healthy, above average at sports and stuff (teenage years) 7. pretty straight and easy to manage hair	human
2449	My bro took both my parent's good features but also took most of my mum's bad features so hmm...	human
2450	Short is not good as a girl either	human
2451	But you managed it anyway! :D	human
2452	Looks nice!	human
2453	Omfg	human
2454	If you really dont want to stay then just don't give in. She can't force you anyway	human
2455	Pavel was one until he got buffed so I took the chance to raise him to T5! So satisfying  I want to raise Cleo but lacking the resources after building Pavel. So I'm building Roi now.  I also want to raise Mediana, Priscilla and Ophelia! But resources take so much time. I might be building Mitra after Roi just to stock up on wizard frags.	human
2456	Yes	human
2457	I followed your advice and I did it!!! Thanks so much!!!	human
2458	I think I remember seeing that one, sounds familiar	human
2459	Alright thanks for the tips!	human
2460	Most of the ones on my feed are super well dressed though	human
2461	I mean if they wash it off afterwards then it's a different matter. I'm referring to those who do nothing to clean it off. We are unable to just ~shake it off~ like guys so some droplets just... linger...	human
2462	My Nyx has pretty good gears though. Maxed/nearly maxed earrings, orb, robe. Lacking a proper hat. My Clause dies almost immediately so I'm guessing it's my Clause that is lacking?	human
2463	I tried T5 Nyx, T3 Luna, T5 Pavel and T2 Clause but I still couldn't. I think my Luna's atk is not up to par though. Gears are missing the atk line	human
2464	Wait wtf!!! No!!!!! That's horrible!!!!!!	human
2465	With. Idk how accurate it is but just let her agar lor	human
2466	Ya I saw it like almost 40min later LOL I think by then you offline alr	human
2467	Your days ago was pretty recent btw. I saw most of them since I browse daily, it was pretty numerous, enough to be memorable. People remember. That's the fact. If it really bothers you then you might just wanna make a new acc	human
2468	Doesn't seem like she cares about giving your cousin and his parents face	human
2469	When I was growing up my mum took all of it saying she will put into bank for me. Turns out she never did when I saw my POSB booklet lol but then she compensated me with an estimated amount when opening my personal bank account at 18	human
2470	Well... you have made numerous posts about being downvoted/people hating you so the more you do that the more people remember your username :/	human

2481	Haha this made me realize my cousin, who is the same age as my bro, has to give out angpaos to us this year. Will be so weird for both of them	human
2482	My family stopped visiting entirely for a few years now 	human
2483	Yup. At the expense of no angpao but it's worth it :P  Bf went to msia with his family :( I saw them off last night.	human
2484	Nope. My family entirely stopped going to relatives house for visiting	human

2490	Nope it's salty. Truffle oil is very fragrant so it's very heavenly. I don't really know how to describe the taste if you've never had truffle hmm	human

2506	Came over from r/crusadersquest . Like KR, it was a super generous and f2p friendly game. It was a gacha hero and gacha weapon system, but they made good f2p heroes. Story was great, progressing and hero-building was great.  Until the Season 2 update happened, 'affectionately' dubbed as season pay2win. Devs were banning players left and right (some deserved, some innocent), heroes were severely unbalanced, upgrading heroes was a needless grind (drop rate of 1% for an essential new upgrade feature that came with season2). To top it all off, cq's 3rd anniversary was shortly after the Season 2 update. What did cq give us for anniversary celebration?  8 breads. For non-cq players, bread can be obtained for free to upgrade heroes in the game and pretty easily, from watching ads.  Many long-term players left and now the subreddit is pretty dead.	human
2507	It's k	human

2522	&gt; Can I salvage my top heroes  &gt; I’ve kinda hit a wall in content. I have all worlds 1-6 best in hard mode, world 7 finished in easy, I can’t do normal.  Yup, increase your team's levels. If your level is too low you will have difficulty with content where the mob's levels are significantly higher	human
2523	Green note just came out, after the revamp you'll be able to get 270 frags a day so that should speed things up a lot	human
2524	If you can do ch1-6 conquest hell, then not long at all. I got my team from 79-80 in 2 days. 75-80 would take a week at most.	human
2525	"Hi, I have the same team as you except Luna instead of Kasel.   Nyx is at full potential in T5.   Frey has done very well for my team so far with her healing. I have ""Inner Peace"" T2 perk (heals allies over time), as well as her UW so that really helps. She is T3 for me and I chose Blessing of Light [Dark] for extra 20% atk.  Clause works very well for me with his gears giving him pdef and mdef. I have him at T2, Battle Cry perk (allies max hp extra 15%)  Can't really advice you on who to replace them with but I can tell you that they are pretty decent. Frey, Luna and Clause have been my main team since the beginning and I've gone all the way to Ch7 hard with the addition of Nyx."	human

2531	Good intentions but it really sounds like you're trying to get us to do your homework for you	human
2532	&gt; First of all, you will be able to play each chapter’s Upper Dungeons just like  how you can play the Conquest. In Chapter 7, you were able to acquire 75 fragments at max,  but after the revamp, you will be able to obtain total 270 Fragments a day  if you go through all chapter Upper Dungeons.  OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1	human

2563	Nope, it doesn't! My gag reflex sets off if anything touches the back of my tongue. The retainers don't touch there so it's fine for me.   Ladybug? Ehh??	human
2564	Yeah. Removable and wear at night only. Didn't know there were fixed ones. Metal on top doesn't really bother me but the bottom one does	human
2565	Looks like it	human
2566	/u/penguinmagnet   Acc deleted	human
2567	Rip how come suddenly	human
2568	Hmm I'm using the metal one. I have a sensitive gag reflex too. I have no issues by just resting my tongue on top of the retainers (more like on my teeth). Hopefully the metal one will be better for you since it covers less area	human
2569	Are you using the cover the full teeth one or the metal one? 	human

2573	Ah. I've read Liar Game and Kurosagi (a swindler who swindles other swinlders). That's just what Kakegurui reminded me of.   I tried to read the TG manga but I can't remember where I stopped at. I remember reading the tension though. And I spoiled myself with TG:RE and whew the ship finally sailed	human
2574	I gotta ask... your instructor never ask you to take note of how many points each mistake gives you? Esp the curbs because one isn't a fail and one is an immediate fail	human
2575	Never heard of kakagurui, heard of promised neverland but don't really know what it's about. I watched TG anime but didn't follow up with the manga. Got lazy lolol  I think r/sg should have plenty of weebs actually. r/manga is a nice place to get more manga to read!	human
2576	Plenty! Relife, kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to, chihaya-san's fine that way, Dr Stone, the newer ones etc. More slice of life now though	human
2577	Welp ok guess I'll be watching the anime	human
2578	Yeah lol though a bit too late for not taking it too serious	human
2579	&gt; Got go circuit and road just before the test  This is the warm up round	human
2580	Ahhh ok! I'm more of a manga person. My bro has told me to read it but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet	human
2581	It's alright, it was him who mentioned that info anyway not you haha. Yeah he stopped replying already it's fine thanks :)	human
2582	&lt;Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!&gt;	human
2583	"Why are you saying sorry each time you talk to me hahahahhaha it doesn't make me uncomfortable. What makes me more ""uncomfortable"" is this merlion dude projecting his on insecurities on me"	human
2584	I suppose LOL Shoujo has the self-aware males. I think.	human
2585	"Ok lor, you just want to assume anyone is simply jealous of another person having boner/got game then ok lor. No point talking to someone who can't understand ""literally talking cock"" and just assume everyone here is jealous.  You're not out here to have a proper conversation anyway so meh"	human
2586	"The fuck? I'm a female. Jealous for fuck?  I'm saying it's one thing to ""talk cock"", it's another to talk about when you got a boner. "	human
2587	It's one thing to talk cock, it's another to *literally* talk cock	human
2588	I think the typical male protagonist is self-aware. They just think their crush don't like them back then it's a super frustrating back and forth where each time one of them wanna confess to each other sure will have 3rd party interruption	human
2589	lol wtf. but ok I had a poly classmate who got a boner from holding his then-gf's hand so.... I dunno why he decided to tell the whole group of us, likewise I dunno why you decided to announce it on r/sg	human
2590	Tbh he's just very oblivious of his own feelings. All my friends knew he liked me before he himself realized he liked me	human
2591	Nothing, because bf in NS :(	human
2592	&gt; looked closely at Computer Science and Computer Engineering that were offered by both NUS or NTU  Yet thinks that 3.0 can get in. If you really looked closely you'd see the requirements on their websites.	human
2593	Omg hahahahhaa	human
2594	Funny story, my bf (who was just a friend then) told me on the Monday before valentine's that if nobody asked me out for valentines then he would. As friends. It somehow became a bet where he bet someone would ask me out, I bet nobody would and the loser will treat the other dinner.  To this day he claims going out as friends was his only intention even though I was top on his list of who to ask out that day :p	human
2595	"Quotes don't really do anything for me. The only one that has stuck with me is ""Treat others how you want others to treat you."" which I kept to all the way until sec sch where I stopped because I realized no matter how nice you are, there will always be people who never appreciate it and try to screw you over :/"	human

2658	"Thanks! The term ""savoury"" is actually so widely used, like for pancakes/crepes sweet vs savoury so I really just thought it was salty lol"	human
2659	I wasn't exactly fashionable haha her point was I looked too much like a guy :/	human
2660	Yeah you're right	human
2661	Ohhh alright. Thanks!	human
2662	Ah are you in education? Sounds like you have the authority to change things? It will be tough to create a fantastic system that won't turn out like ours. All the best! :)	human
2663	My impression is that savoury meant salty. What's the difference?	human
2664	Woah. Thanks	human
2665	"I am now average weight but was skinny for about 18 years of my life. Read the comments, didn't notice that painful seating due to lack of cushioning is true. It still is despite being average weight. I guess fat just didn't go to my ass.  Anyway, many things  * Constantly being told by girls they're jealous that I'm skinny and that they wished they had my body. Put some thought into it, idiots. Skinny comes with a lot of cons.  * People constantly making jokes that I will fly away when there's a strong wind. Funny when I'm in a good mood, annoying when I've heard it like a hundred times  * Being told to eat more when I obviously ate more than most people at that age. The ONE time I don't eat much because I just didn't feel like it, people jump at the chance to say ""that's why you're so skinny"". stfu  * People automatically assume you're weak. Which is actually true. It has affected my self esteem so much that now I'm afraid to try strength activities at my full strength because I don't want my self esteem to take a hit if I fail.  * People like to grab my wrist and act like it's a circus freak show, and start calling everyone nearby to look at how skinny my wrist is.  * Skinny + short + baby face... people don't tend to take me seriously. My body is not curvy at all so my body just looks like a young teen's. Some people with baby faces get treated like adults because they're tall so they look like their age. It's so unfair.  * People liked to randomly carry me just because they wanted to ""try""  * People calling me cute, like ""small and cute"", like how someone reacts when seeing a baby animal.  Also now that I'm average weight, my mum keeps telling me to lose it because of the fat around my waist. Sigh you just can't win"	human
2666	"&gt; (ie. They won’t be able to attract a man) is still alive.   OMFG this pisses me off so much. My (Asian) mum kept telling me to dress more girly or grow my hair out if not guys wont see me as a girl. Ummm hello mum, you KNOW that I have a boyfriend. Her reply to that is ""ya but what if someone better than him comes along but you miss out because they don't see you as a girl?"" To which I reply, ""if they dismiss me just because of my hair or dressing then I don't want them either."" or ""Why do I need to attract guys in the first place?"" That usually ends the discussion but doesn't stop her from constantly bringing it up.  Ironically I have started dressing more girly and growing my hair out because I want to look good for my boyfriend lol."	human
2667	"Pasting here what I just wrote in another comment:  Huh, in my country (Singapore), we're divided up by results past primary 2. My govt strongly believes in meritocracy, basically getting rewarded for results. This has led to an elitist and overly competitive mindset among upper middle class families. Eg must get into top class, then get into top secondary school etc. Our govt is now trying to reverse this by saying ""every school is a good school"" but it's obviously not working.  Also I mentioned ""upper middle class"" because wealth privilege is a very real thing. I went to one of the top secondary schools in my country (top non-IP school, but that's a bunch of details for another day). In that school, everyone came from similar backgrounds. Most of them had happy normal families, undivorced parents, high-salaried parents, every family had a car and cars are absurdly expensive here. Most of them could afford 1-2 family vacations a year.    So when the child manages to grow up in a very comfortable lifestyle, there is a very high chance of them being one of the ones with ""better abilities"" even though there could be just as intelligent, less fortunate kids who didn't have their chance to shine, just because of their home environment.  Tldr: It's a lot more complicated than just putting kids together based on ability"	human

2672	That article is trying too hard to be funny so I gave up. Tldr?	human

2680	I was napping while my phone was on a chair nearby. Woke up and saw 2 missed calls from a hp number almost 1h ago. Called them back saying I got missed call from that number. They said they called me back twice because they got a missed call from my number at around 2.30pm+  ?!?! I was sleeping during that time and my phone's logs doesn't have that outgoing call at all. Does anybody have any idea what could've happened? I don't recognize caller's voice at all	human

2715	Oh thank god	human
2716	&gt; I mean, if you do not have money why play games?  are you ok?	human
2717	Eh I guess every game will have players that get bored. It's just that the ones who are bored are more vocal about it. The ones who aren't bored have nothing to say about it.  I used to play Crusaders Quest. There are many players who have played from the first day (3 years, like the long term SW players you mentioned) but I got bored of the game after a few months. That's personal preference I suppose. Personally I would get bored if I can't even clear early game content quickly. I like to see progress so KR is good for me	human
2718	The most recent maintenance made levelling up at lower levels a lot easier, but made it harder to level from 71-80 so there's that  Things you can grind/farm in this game  1. BD/RD/whatever dragons for equips 2. Raids for raid points for raid equip to grind into materials to get NPC heroes 3. EXP grind 4. EXP potion farming once you can clear hell stages 5. Fragments for awakening heroes 6. More fragments for essences for transcending heroes 7. More fragments for infinity fragments for infinity stones for transcending heroes 8. Stockade for skill books for the many heroes you can obtain (200sb per skill; 12sb per key on hell mode)   Btw I've never played Summoners War. Does it not bother you that you can't even clear early game content within a month?	human
2719	So I joined in Nov and only got my first T5 hero a few days ago. That's barely even enough for late game content so nope. It's not too easy. On top of getting UW 'easily', you'll have to get it multiple times to awaken the UWs (increase the stars) to unlock the full potential of certain heroes.	human

You can try looking at fave for any discounts to go places you wouldn't normally go to. I've eaten at Le Rida under fave's offer and it was really good. It's non air-con and it's sort of out of the way though  Platypus Kitchen at bugis is also good from what I can remember and it's not too ex.	human

2778	.........ok 	human
2779	18	human
2780	Dont you have a gf	human
2781	She could've been interested but decided that was a dealbreaker so she left :/ Honestly that amount of spent time together is definitely more than platonic. I don't even spend that much time with my best friend.   Btw I think we're misunderstanding the definition of 'interested' here. To me interested just means a little crush, but I'm guessing for you it means love? So I'm just referring to her having a little crush on you and unfortunately it wasn't enough for her to stay :/	human
2782	&gt; Then again, even if she texts you from the moment she wakes up till the minute she sleeps, go out with you - movie, dinner, drinks till 3am on a school / work night: all these still doesn't mean she's interested. Sharing happy moments together seriously don't mean jack.  Am female and I'm pretty sure this means that she's interested..... Unless she's just intentionally leading you on	human
2783	She's not interested	human

2787	Check posting times too. Bots don't need to work or sleep so you might find that they are equally likely to post throughout the day, or conversely they might be coded to only operate during a period of time, so you'd never see them post during a window.	human
2788	Among other things, I'd look for evidence of conversations. An interaction of Bot -&gt; Human -&gt; Bot is probably a sufficient Turing Test for most people, so I'd guess that bots won't reply and are likely to mainly post as a root comment, not as a reply.	human
2789	If your dementia is sufficiently advanced that you can't remember / solve the puzzle of the doors, best you can't leave. It's devious.   Like having really narrow doors in an obesity clinic (although you'd need a loading bay to get people in).	human

2792	I only played the multiplayer once with a friend, but it was *so* good. Obviously I played as the alien, he went human.   One of the amazing things about the game is that most of the lights are destructive. I went around knocking out lights and would just work on freaking him out by buzzing him when he got to the dark sections. Not attacking him but making him aware that I knew exactly where he was and running past or a single claw swipe to let him know I could have munched his head just destroyed him.	human
2793	Can't watch it. Jerry is too infuriating. 	human

2795	"Ok, it used to be that in the traditional household the man would be the breadwinner and the wife would not work. A single income was sufficient to support the family. Now it takes two. The world has progressed out of all recognition technologically to make us more effective and efficient, but we seem to be getting less value for each hour worked. All of the groups you mention will suffer for this, except working women who have seen an improvement in pay.  Immigration used to be more lax, so minorities were better off on that score. There are other individual points which could be made, but it is just cherry-picking. It is true that there have been social advancements for all of the groups you mention which outweigh the deficits. However, a rising tide raises all ships. If it was the case that the US was making strides to improve in those areas where its cohort countries were not, then I'd accept your argument.   Many people who do say ""how great America used to be"" and are anti-intellectual. That doesn't mean there is a dependency. It takes some humility to say that some things used to be better."	human
2796	Well, that's [the last of it trickling away](https://www.salon.com/2011/04/19/scott_adams_sock_puppetry_scandal/).  Thank you. 	human
2797	"America has largely been keeping up with these social trends in Western culture, not been pioneering them.  We live in a world of increasing anti-intellectualism, *that* is something that is new and frightening. ""Expert"" is now used as a pejorative term. If you look at our news, it's all reports. There's precious little of putting current events into historical context or interpreting what they mean going forward. We just get more thrown at us, as if that's better. We know what someone we went to school who we haven't seen for years had for lunch, but we don't know how a protectionist trade stance will impact our quality of life over the next 5 years and what it will mean for the countries who are being shut out.   Worse, most people are more interested in the lunch post."	human
2798	Alien vs Predator, playing as a puny human, knowing that if you miss an alien it will end you and you'll have to replay 10 minutes. It's so atmospheric. All's quiet, then you get a blip on the motion detector. Arrrgh!	human

2802	In light of the election, isn't that brutally and painfully accurate?	human
2803	Yes, you're missing the next part. Two people can agree that America used to be better, one can appeal to people's baser instincts that it's the fault of foreigners and minorities and another can say that people got complacent, stopped striving at school, stopped being interested in the world, stopped trying to be better.  The first person will suggest deporting and suppressing those problem people and find more scapegoats when nothing changes, the second will want to help and inspire people to be better.  Same problem, two different perspectives and different solutions.	human
2804	Yeah, I lost a pile of respect for him when I heard that. Trump is the  pointy-haired boss incarnate, how does he not see that?	human

2807	It's classic ignorant management. There must be a few fantastic Dilberts on the subject. Here's my best approximation of how the story goes...  Manager: Do this  Subordinate: I would, but x will get in the way  Manager: Ok, make x not get in the way, don't you see, we need solutions, not problems?!  Subordinate: Yeeeeah, ok. I'll get back to you on that  Manager to self: Daaamn, I managed the shit out that situation, that's why I earn the big bucks!	human
2808	Nah, she always lands on her feet.	human
2809	"The problem is that Trump only thinks in terms of ""winning"" and therefore zero sum games. You can see the mentality from his business life where he chooses small contractors and screws them over final payments when they only have unaffordable legal recourse.    For him, everything is a one-round prisoner's dilemma because there's always another supplier or contractor. This approach isn't going to work on the international stage, or ""biglys"". "	human

Trump isn't about to face off against a nation that is a real threat, he's a weak bully, not suicidal (diet notwithstanding).

Usually it'll be a case of I feel that if I need bash you with ""family values"" when you're caught having an affair for various reasons, despite the fact that I'm hiring escorts every weekend. That's very low behaviour of me. I'm claiming high ground that I don't have a right to.  This is worse.  Trump had a clean slate because he'd never had the opportunity to play fast and loose with security. He *did* have the high ground (although it can be argued that his position was weaker because he had never had to work with the realities of Office). However, it meant he had to go out and actively descend to the level of behaviour he was criticising.  That's more like me criticising you over your affair, but the with my first annual bonus which gives me enough money, I go and get a hooker, or a deficit hawk saying going on a reckless spending spree is ok as soon as their party has the purse strings or...or...or...or..."	human
2828	The company has started to ask me to do sales now. As far as I can tell this means I work very hard to build a relationship and identify an opportunity on top of the day job, a sales person will come in, seal the deal and take a sales bonus.

2833	At some point, you've got to trust someone, although if you are sufficiently paranoid that can be only a teensy bit of trust.  If you pay for a VPN then there is a business which will have trouble staying in business if they give up your data. Jurisdiction always makes things a hassle, so don't get one that is UK based and do a bit of research to find a reputable company with decent infrastructure.   A VPN doesn't make you bulletproof, but it should make you too much effort to bother with - unless you're doing something sufficiently heinous.   Don't do something sufficiently heinous.  Unless they're sketchy AF a VPN will keep an absolute minimum of information on you and how you use their service so there's nothing for anyone to pursue apart from the fact that you have paid them money, a fact an investigator would already have.  With something like Opera, you have to be concerned about the old adage that *if the product is free, then you are the product.*   Internet security is a bottomless rabbit-hole, you can go as deep as you want. However, having a VPN is fast becoming a matter of Internet hygiene. People might say that we've never needed this in the past, well this a bit like putting a letter in an envelope rather than writing a postcard that anyone can read.

2834	"These days many jobs are IT and knowledge based. Knowledge is based on information, information is based on data and you can manipulate data with programming.  The number of jobs where Python is required in the job description is large and wide ranging. The number of jobs where Python isn't even considered, but could vastly improve the rolw is enormous. There are very few ""mature"" companies, most of the rest are in stuck in the 90s because no one knew what to do after buying MS Office and people are bastardising Excel.  Python is amazing for fixing small things in a company. By automating part of your job you make time for yourself to work on things which will make you shine.

2835	If you look at it from a distance, it's even more cynical.   They're taking the demographics most likely to get upset with the social order, removing them from that horrible environment and controlling and shaping them through the years when they're most likely to revolt against the system which leaves their communities at the bottom of the heap because a more manageable number of young men are left to act against the status quo, be that through protest, direct action or crime. 	human

2838	That's such a loaded phrase, it wouldn't be one I'd use. However, I think it does people in the Services a disservice to talk about them as if they lacked the volition to make impactful, informed choices over their lives. That makes them victims.	human

Also, as you get better at engaging with them, they're less frustrating because you learn how to let them play to their strengths. It's not easy, but worth it.

If there is a failure in communication, it's the fault of the communicator not the communicatee. People walking off - that's your fault.  It sounds like amongst your problems, you misjudge your audience. Perhaps things like complex mathematical problems are easy for you, but if they're hard for other people and you don't explain well enough, or they simply aren't interested, then they'll walk. The fool who ""gets"" the simple maths is communicating on their level, concepts which they (just about) understand and are relevant to them. He might be slightly ahead of them, but they can see that it's just a little, so they can identify with him. You're saying that you're streets ahead, complaining that these ""retards"" who you can't take seriously are so far behind, yet you're clearly yearning for their company and respect. You're trying to have your cake and eat it.  If you are as clever as you think, then in your life you will find a couple of dozen people with whom you can spar and connect as equals. The rest of the time you will be mentally ahead of the crowd. If you're 10 steps ahead, pretend to be 2 steps, or 0 steps and get lucky or have sudden insights. Don't seek to impress or intimidate people by being clever, but accompany them on their journey, even if you are slowly retracing your steps. As you are, you'll never take anyone with you. You might hate to admit it, but you need other people. It's other people who will give you love, friendship, accolades and job promotions.

2865	"Gaming is always going to be the problem with laws. Laws are the rules of the game and there will always be people who try to find loopholes. What do you propose? A loophole bounty like in programming?   The problem is always going to be that laws are incomplete, so there will be ways around them. If we think of it in terms of Game Theory, if it's a one round game, the ""smart"" move will always be to obey the letter rather than spirit. Also, if the payoff is sufficiently big, the smart move will still be to take the unethical/lucrative path because you can move away and buy new friends. However, for the more day-to-day ethical question, you'd hope that between the cost in subsequent games where everyone hates you and an internal moral compass, someone would do the ""right"" thing. It might be tempting to steal a co-worker's cookie, but being known as the cookie-thief forevermore isn't worth it. The difficulty is that as social ties loosen people seem to be caring less and less about being known as the cookie-thief.  I absolutely agree with you that laws are part of the solution, but I can't see how they get us all the way there in the real world. I do accept that my position is somewhat idealistic, especially given that so many people do seem to require a supreme being with a big stick to act ethically and fewer and fewer people are buying into that. "	human
2866	I'd say that it's more of a pendulum. You have to have an up-swing so that the powerful enact laws against the powerful to protect the weak. We're currently seeing a down-swing in the US where parts of the government have been captured by industry and guidelines and laws do not seem to be enforced.   Hopefully there will be a reaction which will lead to an up-swing and we'll see new laws and ways of working which will be more ethical.   My concern is that as a society we're losing our sense of community and that feeling that keeps us in line - shame. People care less and less about the actions of others which in turn gives people more liberty to act badly because there is no social consequences to their actions. I think it's good that we are becoming a more secular society, but one thing that faith and churches do is force people together who know one-another's business and there's a social conscience at work. Obviously there's often something like the threat of hell too, but I'd say that generally being an outcast among your peers is more of an influence.  	human
2867	I'd argue that culture is maintained by laws. You can't pass a law that the law-makers disagree with, so culture has to come first. That culture might initially only be in the ruling elite and the subsequent upholding of the law instils it in the wider culture, but it's always going to start with culture.   The US is going through a real test of character at the moment, what's been happening under this administration is casting many spotlghts, too many spotlights, on the many ways many arms of the government has been subverted by interests which are not for the people. There is so much to do, it's going to be hard working out where to start. Someone is going to though or short term gains are going to ruin the country.   Anyway, I digress. I agree that you need laws and good laws. However the people will only step forward and make good laws without the regard for personal backlash will do so due to culture. By laws need to be followed in spirit as well as letter, that's also where culture comes in.   I suspect we're arguing from quite similar positions. 	human
2868	I'm not sure I follow you.  I wouldn't call it a conspiracy, there's nothing secretive about it. I would call it reckless scaremongering and a dangerous call to arms.	human
2869	I agree that you can do a lot with laws, but it's impractical to legislate for everything - you just need to look at the world of accountancy for proof.   So you do what you can and have to rely on the culture to do the rest. Unfortunately between the current administration and regulatory capture, the culture is toxic.	human
2870	"It'll be the ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy used again. No gun adept would leave their gun unattended, so it wouldn't be an issue.  The whole argument is designed to get people snarled up in the insanity and impracticality of it all. There's just too much to be argued against and it's designed to be argued against. With just a little gentle trolling to keep things rolling, they can wrap everyone up with fighting against something that never could be implemented rather fighting for legislation which might make a difference."	human
2871	"The juxtaposition of ideas has the overwhelming implication of a literal call to arms.  The National Rifle Association can't call on people to fight without implying that...you know...rifles will be involved. If they were the Nation Fluffy Bunny Lovers Association, there would not be the same connotations attached, or, if the subject were a law and they said ""Fight with your vote,"" then yes, it's an abstract fight and the weapon has been specified.   When they have identified a group of *people*, Democrats (from ""their ex-President""), who are to be *fought* against, ones who it has suggested are violent and hurt innocents then the last minute abstraction of fighting with truth doesn't matter because the audience has already been led down the path of thinking that they need to fight physically.   The intonation throughout demonstrates this, especially at the end, ""is to **fight this violence** of lies with the **clenched fist** of truth.""  In essence, this video is saying, ""This is your enemy. Fight them ^^^with ^^^truth ."" It can only be defended in the most cynical of ways.  tl;dr Linking ideas by putting them next to one another and holding an audience's hand to connect the dots is as bad as saying something outright.

2872	The question is how unrealistic are the expectations of the outcome of his inquiry?   What will happen if and when people are massively disappointed by the lack of change?	human
2873	I'm at a loss as to what happens next. I don't think it's practical to codify everything into law, everything is going to seize up.   However, there is an implicit assumption in Government that there will be an overall baseline of integrity and honor, so if someone is corrupt, others will pull them up on it and because they've been caught, they'll bow out. What we have now is a system where everything is so corrupt, supervisory bodies are not doing anything about infractions and when the press exposes things the culprits shrug their shoulders and carry on.  Supervision doesn't work when the supervisors are complicit. Shame doesn't work when those doing wrong have no honor and feel no shame.	human

2886	I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised.  I always say that the best way to tell that someone gets a concept is that they can joke about it. Making a joke requires you to be able to play with and subvert an idea. The fact that Obama can make self-deprecating jokes shows humility and he understands the jokes and opposing positions from the other side.   Compare that to Theresa May. She doesn't seem to have any sense of humour or empathy. She's probably a fine administrator, but she's a disaster at listening to advice, making policies and being a leader anyone wants to follow.	human
2887	I keep noticing US cop shows often have their characters not wearing seatbelts. I've heard the reason is that it doesn't look good on camera.

2888	Many have already spawned, so it is only a limit on the heritability of their genes and society is left looking after their sprogs.	human
2889	I think it's due to focus. Many leaders get to the top because they are driven by their goal and things like humour are distractions. However, I'd say it is a key trait for great leaders because it requires imagination and non-linear thought. Obama is an ideal example.  The obvious US example to support this would be Trump. However, while he clearly lacks a sense of humour (the only thing he seems to find funny is publicly belittling people who can't retaliate) it doesn't seem related to his success or lack of it because he lacks focus.   Also, it's a general rule that people conflate professionalism with being serious. The likes of Google are breaking this down because they realise that a culture of uniformity and stifling formality doesn't make for an innovative company.	human

You can manually distress the text in gimp, but I don't think that there is anything pre-made.  Longer answer: It's best to do this yourself if you want the best possible look. If you're more idle, you might choose to find a distressed font, but you'll find that as a maximum, you'll have two variations of each letter. All you need to do is find a grungy brush and use it to erase part of the text. Better practice would be to use a layer mask rather than erasing the text directly. Alternatively, you could [find a larger grunge texture and use that as one big mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRwpHBQPhuM) for a more natural effect.	human

Many guys see the gym as out of bounds for approaching girls, it's really up to you to ""accidentally"" bump into him outside and see if he fancies a post-workout coffee. Guys are paranoid that we come off creepy when there's a girl we are attracted to and can't keep our eyes off.   I've known a couple of people without filters and they haven't changed. They're oblivious to the social cues which would tell them to STFU. One in a professional context I have simply had to avoid, she's too much of a liability to my career. She's happy, friendly and had no problem going on and on about how I sounded hungover after work drinks in a meeting when I was seeing some senior managers for the first time. She's not going to change, so i can't afford to be around her.  You should have a word with your housemate about slamming doors. That kind of behaviour is much easier to modify than not being able to pick up on social cues.   As for the rest, she sounds human. We all get crabby and snarky at times. If I haven't had much sleep, followed by a rough day, I'll tell people that I'm not good company right now because I know that I get irritable and actively trying to not be irritable, well, it makes me irritable. If she needs some space, then give it to her - unless she's monopolising a communal area.  Some people are best at a distance. Someone can be and absolute riot, but you wouldn't want to have that 24/7. That might be why your friends like her better, it's in small doses for them and you can forgive eccentricity when you don't have to live with it.  In short, I think you might be able to modify her actions like slamming doors, but not her filterless personality. You'll either have to find peace with it or get distance."	human
2956	"This is far more natural. The question indicates that it's Tanya's turn and gives her a cue for what to say next.

As such it indicates an egotistical (not in a bad sense) view, *I know who I am and what I'm calling about, so obviously you do too.* You tend to get that kind of statement from people who literally can't see things from another person's perspective.

2977	It's good. Some areas where you might improve it are:  * Looks like there is only smoke behind Eugene, put some in front too, but with lower opacity since there won't be so much between him an the camera * You've applied some weird filter to poor Eugene, so it looks like he's made out of plastic or in a computer game, which doesn't tie in with the background. The shadows on him are great, and you want to have lots of contrast (maybe a bit pronounced on the crotch, but a guy has his pride), but the smoothing on him is going the wrong way. You want gritty. Likely something in g'mic that'll help - look under artistic. Also you might look at [Pat David's site](https://patdavid.net/2013/02/calvin-hollywood-freaky-details-in-gimp.html) * Another issue is that Eugene isn't blended with the background. You've done a fine job of cutting him out, from the sharpness I'd guess you used curves which is a solid option. The problem is that it's too sharp - again making it look like a computer game where object blending is often poor. All you need to do is add some feathering. Select the transparent region, go to select -&gt; feather -&gt; Set this to maybe 4px and hit ok. Now press delete a couple of times and it'll blur the edges.	human

2985	With far less, companies already specialise in segmenting voters to find groups which can be motivated to go to the ballot box or change their vote by appealing to their worst fears and prejudices.   They can be hacked, sell it or be forced to give it to the government.

2992	The more unionised industries have driven those industries into the ground. Tube drivers can still pull their shit because they are in a government backed monopoly which is vital to keep London running.

My approach would have been similar, but to use Inkscape for the landmasses so I could easily change the coastlines and move them around, before importing into gimp for colouring and texturing.  For the actual game, give the map a good crumple. I'd add a crumpled paper texture for digital viewing, just use ""overlay"" or ""multiply"" with an image of crumpled white paper and modify the opacity so it looks crumpled, but not enough that it would distort the image.   If my geography-fu were a bit stronger, I'd say something about plate tectonics. You've clearly considered that, but the movement and scale doesn't feel quite right to me. Perhaps there are elements that will be explained by your narrative.   All in all, a fab map. Great choice of typefaces and tidy design."	human
2996	Please be kind, this is a genuine question.  What's so bad about the Tebbit Test?  Obviously, it's somewhere between quite and massively offensive to be asked, but if you want a rule of thumb to assess how integrated 1st, 2nd, 3rd generation immigrants are, doesn't it have some merit?	human
2997	When you over-extend and misrepresent someone's argument, you end up with something ludicrous and easy to dismiss.

As you suggest, no point in continuing. 	human

""A few people slightly inconvenienced"" suggests that a life might be worth less than a lot of people massively inconvenienced. Now a sensible discussion of where to draw the lines can start.

3002	"Whenever I start thinking about it, I start thinking we need to legislate cars much more. Driving down the road at 70mph, you're literally 3 seconds away from death.  My personal opinion is there's only a small place in society for guns. I'm ok with hunting if you eat what you kill or it's to control pests. I'm ok with target shooting if you don't use human-shaped targets and keep the gun at a gun club. Beyond that, I need some pretty strong arguments why they're needed. ""Because tyranny"" feels a bit weak."	human
3003	"No, I was explicitly saying that if he were having an internal debate or arguing with someone, the not McDonalds / not meth side would win every time. I wasn't saying anything about enforcement or government involvement.   To try another analogy, if you dive into a deep swimming pool, you're going to have to swim up a long way before you give in to the voice in your head saying, ""Can I start breathing now?"" At every foot before you reach the surface, the right answer of the question is going to be ""No."" It isn't because you're anti-breathing, but given the circumstances, breathing is not the optimal action at that time. "	human
3004	We're talking about a life here, maybe a child's life. You monster!	human
3005	That's partly why it's a pants argument, it doesn't allow for any such subtlety.   Come on! Think of the children! 	human
3006	No, my analogy was based on positions in an argument, not binding it tightly to the gun situation.   In Jerry's case, his actions are a long way off healthy. Any argument he has with himself or anyone else to go for a burger, he's going to lose because he's so far over the line. However, there is a line to be found where he could go for a burger. It still might not be the optimal choice, but there's scope there.   Jerry's hobby is doing meth. (I'm not sure Jerry is long for this world.) Again, any argument he has with himself or someone else about meth would lead to the conclusion that he should do less meth. The key difference here is that the optimum amount of meth someone should smoke is none.   For a long time, there will be no difference in the outcomes of those two arguments, both are unhealthy activities and Jerry is so deeply on the unhealthy side he's going to have to give up a lot of ground if he's going to be rational. That's what i mean by direction of travel. The question is whether guns are a burgers or meth.   How much actual violence and death is it worth accepting as the price for a speculative ability to fight off a hypothetical tyranny?   I'm not saying anything about enforcement here, simply that if someone is very wrong, they've got a long way to go before they can start being right.	human
3007	"Only if you reduce it to absurdity.   Let's say Jerry likes McDonalds. He really likes McDonalds. He goes there for every meal and orders multiple burgers. He weights 150lbs and it's killing him. He should reduce the number of burgers he eats. He should eat somewhere else some times, most of the time. It's not a slippery slope. We're not saying that he should stop eating, that would be ridiculous. However, he is so far at one end of the spectrum, for some time the right answer to every ""Should I go to McDonalds..."" question is going to be ""No."""	human
3008	"""If it saves just one life, then yes,"" is a terrible argument. If cars were limited to drive at 10mph, thousands of lives would be saved, but we're not going to do that because it wouldn't be ""worth it"".   I'm not objecting to your position, only your choice of argument. "	human
3009	"More a sensible direction of travel from an unsafe society to a progressively safer society, than a slippery slope. If when confronted with the statement ""We should do x to reduce the number of people killed by guns,"" the gun lobby is on the opposing side every time, it's possible their position is simply untenable. "	human
3010	It's been my experience that the people who are most against people being judgemental are those who get up to some nefarious activities.

He played by the rules and got screwed over at every turn, right down to his wife suggesting he'd been violent towards her to help her in the divorce. Then on that day, it would only have taken someone showing him some humanity to defuse the situation. The system and the people working it meant he hadn't had a good day in a long time and wasn't going to get another. Things just came to a head on this one.  My interpretation is that it's a story of a guy who simply wants to give his daughter a present on her birthday and the unfairness of society makes him crack and stop playing by the rules that have worked against him at every turn.	human

3023	"To take your points:  1. I'm sorry but did you not read ""special relationship""? The fact that we are ideologically close, our shared language and history does make us more important to them than the rest of the world. We are seen as their closest ally so they both have a vested and general interest in what happens here.   1. Fine.  1. You shouldn't censor your friends and it is worrying that they chose to censor something to which their viewers could relate.  1. I didn't go into ""special properties you can't actually go into"" because I was treating you with the respect that you know what the ""special relationship"" is, even though I did allude to what it is. It's not my job to educate you. I hope you're just a troll because otherwise you are a horrific indictment of our education system as well as our level of civility."	human

How about the more reasonable, ""UK"".   The UK and US supposedly have a ""special relationship"". We have a shared history and similar ideologies. We often take their side in disputes, even supporting them in wars. That should go both ways.   You might argue that highlighting a terrorist attack in ""a fucking parade"" isn't appropriate. Well, that's another discussion. However, for good or ill, we felt that it was important enough to mention and it was not for them to censor it.   Your argument is completely egotistical. ""You didn't miss anything, so why should you care,"" pretty much sums it up. The opening ceremony was a chance to tell the world something about us. It wasn't just a bit of entertainment, but an opportunity when the whole world was watching to make a statement. It isn't just about my enjoyment, but communicating something directly to people around the world who usually wouldn't get a message. NBC filtered that message.   Your tl;dr is inaccurate.

3026	I care that a major broadcaster to our most powerful ally chose to censor a reference to a major terrorist attack on us because Americans should know that it happened and should be able to draw parallels between 9/11 and 7/7. America is becoming more and more isolationist and this kind of thing is just another small step on that path.  A few years ago I saw some of the US coverage of another Olympics. All it was was American after American winning event after event. They don't get to see the amazing performances of other countries in some broadcasts because it flies in the face of the America is the best narrative. 	human

That no Londoner would not have known if someone had not told them is irrelevant and misleading. We wouldn't know a lot of important things if no one told us. That doesn't mean that they're not important.  The censorship has implications about the kind of relationship between the US and the UK and how the US media treats its viewers. 	human
3030	"Don't hold back. It might take a little while to build up some new skills, but if you're aware that they need work, that's half the battle. If you hold back, less self-aware people will jump into the roles you want and learn on the job as you need to.  The main thing to master is the transition from working in a team to working on a team. It's your job to make sure that the right mix of skills are available to deliver your projects and that things are being done on time and to a satisfactory quality. Make sure your definition of ""satisfactory"" is what the project requires, not your own which is likely to be unnecessarily high. Good enough is good enough.  A good manager will set clear objects for their staff. You need to work out what good looks like, define it, communicate it, measure it and achieve it. People are happy if they know what they should be doing and that their objectives are achievable.  Finally, it's your job to manage any blocks your team encounters. You've established what is good, your team is shooting for it, but external forces will come into play, it's your job to manage those. Don't get dragging into working in the project too much to help your team because you can do their job better. "	human

3032	Facebook's incentives all push it in that direction and its leadership hardly come from a background strong in ethics.  Facebook make money by knowing who you are so they can sell advertising to you better. I assume they sell information about you too. Therefore they'll want to prioritise comment.  News organisations are seen as customers. If anything, Facebook will want to inhibit the transfer of articles so the media will pay them for another 10k views. That in turn will push the news organisations to push only their most click-baity stories to maximise unpaid distribution, news the lowest common denominator wants to hear will win out over what needs to be heard. 	human

3045	It's the same with internet bullying. These things do not need specific legislation, they're already covered, so seem more about increasing reach.  Protests are already banned from where politicians might have to take notice of them, this looks like another step towards further insulating them from the ire caused by their decisions. Politicians should be the least protected from protest.  Let the current laws deal with people at Mogg's visit. 	human

I don't think it should see it as a condition due to the lack of specificity and how changeable it is. Perhaps we do think in certain ways which lead us to some of these traits, but that doesn't absolve us of responsibility or mean that we can't do anything about them.   tl;dr It's better than a horoscope, but it's an imperfect lens which can be useful to look through, but shouldn't be trusted too far."	human

3052	"Mogg was acting like the only civilised person in the confrontation.   Personally, I think Mogg should have been given more time to try to defuse the situation, if the main protester continued to play ""Won't debate"" on repeat, then Mogg should have been sent to the front of the room and someone should have invited the guy to leave verbally, invited him to leave strongly verbally and then physically tossed out his bony arse. "	human
3053	"He was just repeating ""Your views are not worth debating.""  He wasn't going to engage, only disrupt. The question remains, what do you do with someone like that? Remove him, or let him stop the event from taking place?  Whiteshirt acted like fool. It doesn't look to me like baseball cap sunglasses guy was going to leave peacefully, but he escalated things unnecessarily far. "	human
3054	I'd disagree. Covering your face in a society where the social norm is to show it as part of a uniformed group with the aligned intent of disrupting event is hostile.   There are three main reasons for covering your face, because it's cold, for protection and to conceal your identity. Since they were indoors and not in a dangerous environment, it wasn't the first two. So that leaves the third.   Going somewhere with your identity hidden implies that you're planning on doing something for which you don't want to be recognised. It's not an unreasonable assumption that that would be damage to people or property.   I don't care whether it is the police or protesters, while covering your face in our society is not a hostile act, it's a prelude to it and is overtly threatening.	human
3055	Be reasonable.  Turning up at a meeting in a masked, uniformed group and shouting is aggressive.   The guy in the white shirt acted poorly, he should have handled it better.  What was the right action to take? Either these people would have to be removed because they would not be reasoned with, or the vocal minority would prevent the event from taking place.   Politics aside, who should get their way? A small group of people wanting to prevent an event, or a large group wanting to participate?  If it is the latter, then I don't see any other way of it happening than the forceful, but not violent, removal of the disruptive influence.	human
3056	Fascists are not a group in the same way as Antifa. I doubt anyone would call themselves a Fascist. If you do compare like with like, then it's fair to say that the Conservative Party hasn't set up any death camps.

Smith's character did seem confused, especially when he exhibited the kind of racism that seemed to exist within the human population, so should have had some empathy. The coding was ridiculously heavy-handed and made me cringe. However, the pace and action was good and I was interested where it was going to go. In the end, it didn't arrive anywhere, but it didn't feel like a bad ride in the relatively unexamined way I watched it.   After seeing Lindsay expertly pick it apart, I like it a lot less. That's not to say she has spoiled it for me, rather that I've gained an appreciation for it which let's me value it more accurately.

Nice thing was, I didn't have a team, it was just a pay grade thing, so pretty sweet for someone still at uni. It was my job to plan and order parts so we didn't run out, but weren't carrying too much stock. It was actually a pretty high stress job because they kept messing with the schedule.  There was a guy there who used to give me a hard time at school. I wouldn't say ""bullying"" because he didn't put the hours in. He'd worked there on the shop floor for 9 months when I came in the second time. He tried to be friendly and joked about some of the times he hurt me, seeming to think I'd find it funny too. I made it clear I didn't want anything to do with him.   A guy who I was working with told me that the dude was going around asking how I got my job and how unfair it was that I just walked into it and that he was super pissed.

I recently read a quote that ran something along the lines of:  &gt; Management is the ability to stand back and watch others do a task less well than you could do yourself.  That was a hard truth.  I'm fortunate that where I work, I don't have to rely on many of my colleagues and while I can do what they do, they can't do what I can. In addition to that, I tend to take on more than my fair share. This is due to the perfection thing and there is still a part of me that craves being told ""well done"" and I don't want to say ""no"".  If I were in your situation, I suppose I'd try and make things public. I'd start a whiteboard or online trello board of commitments to publicly track progress. Someone might be willing to let you down, they are less likely to publicly show that they're breaking their promises.   I might also try some Pavlovian conditioning. Start asking your colleagues for things and showing appreciation. Ask to be handed pens or if they can hold something up for you etc more frequently and reward them with smiles, thanks and cookies. Slowly build the relationship in their mind of being asked to do something by you being easy and leading to something rewarding. Don't over-do it and be annoying though!"	human

Skip the next three paras if you have no legitimate seniority.  I think you need to be stronger, not nicer to your difficult lab partner. You shouldn't have let it go when he accused you of claiming other people's work as your own, but asked him to apologise for the hurtful slur or explain his point of view. Equally, he deserved to be strongly scolded for not ordering the equipment. Rather than just flat out attack, ask him questions. ""When I ask you to order equipment, is it for your sole use? If you don't order equipment that is essential for others because you don't need it, is that a selfish act? Will it damage the research of others? Can this lab operate if people act selfishly and don't do what they agree to do when asked?""

We forget that an attack on an idea or a piece of work equates to an attack on the person who did it in many people's eyes. When the roles are reversed, I can see that my work was substandard and I will analyse what caused it, how to avoid it in future and whether I need to upskill anywhere. Someone else might think ""she hates me"".  If I were you, I'd try reducing the work I did for others and the demands I made of them. If they don't appreciate what you do, then stop. I do this from time to time when people start taking me for granted or think that I'm overstepping. People suddenly remember how much I do, or consider that they'd prefer not to do all the extra bits I do themselves."	human
3108	It says something about the power of branding that once people personally identify with one, they won't believe it has been gutted and replaced with something else because that would mean that part of them has too.  [Reminds me of this...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqY8EosZ2UE)	human
3109	It's undoubtedly a success story, but a model looking for fame and fortune isn't going to stick around in a place of uncertainty and relatively limited opportunity when the likes of Milan and New York beckon. 	human
3110	Indeed. They went the full Llewelyn-Bowen on that place.	human
3111	Perhaps she did have an interior decorator - who hated her.	human
3112	Slovenia was part of Yugoslavia until 1991, so probably wasn't the best place to live before or a few years after.  She was working in Europe in 1992 and moved to the US in 1996, so she'd been in the US for over twice as long as her time in Europe by the time she was nationalized. Also remember that European countries are very different from one another, so you wouldn't feel that Europe was your home.   So when Slovenia  did join the EU, she hadn't lived there for eight years. It would be a strange move to leave her established life in the US because she suddenly had the right to live in her choice of European countries which weren't home.	human
3113	They're good fun. It's a little reminiscent of His Dark Materials, but furies are cooler than daemons.   Overall, I like the reversal of someone without magic having to get by in a world where it's taken for granted and the ingenuity shown to overcome his disability. 	human
3114	In that case, use Inkscape. As it's a vector drawing program the lines are shapes which can be edited giving you far more control. You can do just what you are now, using layers and tracing. It will also automatically trace for you, but I wouldn't recommend that as it'll make mistakes when it guesses what should be joined to what.	human
3115	"Hopefully in a few years ""lab on a chip"" technology should mean it is super-cheap to run a battery of tests then and there, just requiring a drop of blood. If someone came up as positive, they could accept an instant ban or submit a full sample for lab testing. Done."	human
3116	You can't fix them easily, best to draw them without. To do that it takes a combination of practice and using a graphics program which allows you to add smoothing as you draw. Inkscape does this (and might be better for your purpose), I believe Krita and myPaint also do.   Gimp might, but I don't remember as I don't ever draw like this in Gimp.  edit: Gimp does have it, thanks /u/TheDynamicHamza21   Also, use a graphics tablet, a mouse is too much of a blunt instrument. 	human
3117	A rude, bigoted woman who upsets everyone she meets gets invited to trial a new app. It lets her be abusive to the minorities she hates anonymously, hear their unhappy responses and interact with like-minded people. Gradually she becomes invited into more and more immersive experiences, needing expensive tech to really annoy people. She moves from her suburban house where she was upsetting her neighbours into a small apartment, which she rarely leaves, just orders in food so she can get back to calling people names.  Turns out, the app and subsequent upgrades are all simulations so she isn't actually upsetting anyone and she's moved into an apartment block full of bile-filled hermits who have isolated themselves from a grateful society.	human
3118	How childish.	human
3119	It's continuing on the trajectory from the previous administration.   I don't believe any significant changes have been implemented which would have had an effect on the trailing economic indicators yet. 	human

3121	Not a smirk. More...a wry smile/expression?   A sense of humor is such an important quality to have in leaders, it can defuse tense situations, make people want to work with them and gives them some introspection and humility. I miss that.	human
3122	WoT is going to be incredibly difficult to do well. The plot is excellent, but there is so much wrong with the books which should be a feminist masterpiece, but somehow manages to render most of the extensive female cast to interchangeable buxom cardboard cut-outs and copious amount of corporal punishment. It's going to need careful treatment to improve without losing its essence.   Getting the magic not to look cheesy is another minefield. It's much easier for LotR and GoT, where people mostly aren't throwing around fireballs and lifting people with weaves of air.   I want it to work, but I can't bring myself to get my hopes up.	human
3123	Was it smaller and more efficient than the US one?	human
3124	If OP is playing the long game. It's not great for instant gratification. Scores well on instant bewilderment.	human
3125	More likely just reinforce people's opinions one way or the other. One side will see it as showing the newscasters which are causing Trump the most pain for trying to hold him to account, the other side will see it as legitimate evidence that the organisations are out to get him.	human
3126	The answer will be in ~9 months. There's going to be some nuclear families.	human

He didn't apologise at this conference, but he must have known that they were going to ask him about this at every press event.  It would be interesting if the US press all chose a single subject that was clearly wrong and would only ask questions about it.No reporting on anything in the WH agenda, only their evasiveness until it was addressed."	human
3130	"There are Mac owners who want them for their functionality and ones who want them because it is a Mac. Sounds like your bf is in the latter group. In that case I can promise you that unless it comes from an Apple shop, he isn't going to be happy. Apple marketing have worked witchcraft which means that you could create something that is technically better, aesthetically more pleasing and cheaper and an Apple devotee would still prefer an iMac because yours ""isn't a Mac"". Don't fight it, you've already lost. Get him what he wants and enjoy his happiness and try not to die inside too much."	human
3131	It's great, it's powerful, but it isn't intuitive. To be intuitive there has to be a strong parallel to something with which we are already familiar. Once we've learned how to do it, it becomes intuitive, but that's because we have the mental schema for it - itself.	human
3132	&gt;  I use a butterknife to unlock it  This shit just got middle-class.	human
3133	I'd say that compared to destructive editing it's unintuitive. Power and flexibility don't equate to being intuitive. We don't have examples in the real world of operations you can simply reorder to change an end-state on the fly whereas we can all identify with scenarios like adding water to flour, then not being able to go back and add that same water to self-raising flour.	human
3134	Yes. I suppose I made my point poorly. It was that one of the major benefits to Photoshop is NDE, but that isn't anything to do with being intuitive. 	human
3135	GIMP isn't great for text, but for photo editing which is all about filters and masks, I'd say it's just as intuitive as any other editing software because they all use the same paradigm. Non-destructive layers would be cool, but that's quite an abstracted principle, so not relevant to how intuitive it is.  I find GIMP falls down with tasks most suited to vectors (such as text). I tend to use Inkscape to fill in these gaps. Not ideal, but it's not a problem I hit every day, so I can get along with it.  I'd suggest you go and follow some tutorials. Not everything, everywhere is intuitive, some things you've just got to learn.	human
3136	I'm not sure he is. Fair to say Obama was, but I'd say that Angela Merkel has a strong claim to the title.	human
3137	My problem has been that programmers haven't been interested in me. They haven't been curious about what I do or how they can help me, they've only been concerned in solving the computational challenge, not how to integrate it into my workflow and the other opportunities it might afford. Usually get there in the end after extended pummelling, but it's not a way that the people I've encountered from a programming background have wanted to think. OP's mother might benefit from having been solving real-world problems for years which will have changed any narrow-view mindset.	human
3138	It has a huge cast of bosoms. Or is that cast of huge bosoms, I'm never sure. I'm not sure there is sufficient exposition on the personalities attached to them to really qualify as women!  I'm reading the last couple of books right now and I'm sure I detect some gentle irony to Brandon Sanderson's descriptions.	human

3142	"Current differences aside, Bannon and Trump are isolationists. ""America First"" and ""Make America Great Again"" are all about the US against the world and Trumps racism and xenophobia are part of what gets him behind those policies. "	human
3143	I saw a Markov-Chain Trump twitter bot last year. It was frightening. I couldn't tell the difference between it and Trump. Anyone else, you get something like the Harry Potter chapter which is comical and easy to see. Trump is so full of non-sequiturs and odd constructions himself, it's almost impossible to tell.	human
3144	Started rich and in a relatively safe, growth industry.   From what I've read, he's done some sensible things, he's done some stupid things, but he's not done anything clever in his business life. Also, he's been very unethical in his business dealings,  where he has screwed over the little guy. That's worrying from a foreign policy perspective (and internal perspective too - just look at the tax bill).	human
3145	Doesn't his flip-flopping on policy indicate that he doesn't understand what he's talking about? He seems to know whether he is for or against something at any given moment and because his business books have told him he needs to be firm and decisive, he goes all in. However his position isn't based on any knowledge of the situation, so there is no underpinning. That makes him a weathervane, confidently pointing in a direction - which might change in a few hours, as was shown by the security tweets week.	human
3146	"I wonder if it'll become a thing. Due to few actors in Westerns such a John Wayne, a generation of Americans often have what is known as ""creaky voice"" from subconsciously emulating their role-models. "	human
3147	"Much like how his grammar doesn't agree with itself, his hand gestures often don't agree with what he's saying such as an indication to ""pay attention"" when he's halfway through some nonsensical garbage that's no different from the last couple of minutes.   There's not much that most people can do about the dominance thing. The only person to really stand up to him was [Macron](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2017/12/macron-s-biggest-success-standing-trump) who did it with style and very much his own political agenda. For everyone else, it's simply not worth it. Far better to let him get his rocks off in the initial handshake and then try to play to his ego to get what they want."	human
3148	What gets me is the high likelihood that Windows has backdoors and intentionally unclosed loopholes which the likes of the NSA use. Thinking that another government doesn't do the same is an interesting cocktail of naivety and hubris. 	human
3149	"It's one of those responses you're hearing more and more from this party. Every time they're caught in a lie they ""clarify"", usually narrowing the scope to justify the grandiose claims. ""It *was* the biggest crowd to attend a speech...this week."" The clarification undercuts anything that would have been interesting about the original statement, but the goal of the original statement was achieved when it was made. It's so frustrating!  In this case, I'm sure it is possible to find some country somewhere where a politician was burned, but not one that is easily confusable or comparable to the Netherlands."	human
3150	I can't remember the list time I saw this kind of preparation and firm interviewing, so refreshing.   At the same time it is distressing to see Arpalo seems to have so little idea about the job he is going for and how there is some tension between wanting to be a law-maker, being a law-breaker and wanting to leave law to lawyers when he isn't one.   Having people like him in positions of power is **so** dangerous. He's not interested or clever enough to have his own opinion, so he'll just accept the one given to him by the likes of Trump and there's no amount of argument that could possibly change his mind because he doesn't have a position.	human

3156	T2 Sarah might have a chance at taking out the Alien in Alien if she has prep to learn the ship - she's pretty hardcore. As given in the prompt - she's totally scrod.  Ripley would have been fine in Terminator - she wouldn't have picked up the phone.	human
3157	Medium-density fibre-board. It's the material cheap furniture is made out of - lots of tiny bits of wood compressed together. Then a nice bit of veneer is glued on top to make it look like solid wood. Cheap tables of this design use MDF.	human

3160	Fantastic. I love River's expression!  Do you cut their eyes out by hand or are they punched somehow? They're so uniform and perfect.	human
3161	Every element was so sensible.  Conversely Ladies of the time wore clothes which were designed to be impractical to put on yourself to prove that they could afford someone to dress them. We still have the vestiges of it today. You know how a man's shirt and a woman's blouse have buttons on different sides? That's because a man would button his own shirt, while a woman would be dressed by someone else (or at least presented to the world that she was!)	human
3162	Undoubtedly true. I think that their relationship with the party is kind of religious in nature too due to their non-rational belief (aka faith). There is so much evidence that Trump is a bad person doing bad things badly, but they still support him and the party. That's the kind of thing only the most hardcore fan would put up with, so I think it goes beyond that. People see being Republican as part of their identity - that's really dangerous since at the end of the day it is a brand, a container that can be filled with anything and those people will go along with it.	human
3163	Those are quite some pockets. Didn't realise how huge they were.	human
3164	I see the problem was the quietness / secrecy around it. Sure, it is also fishy that it coincided with a new model. Thing is, it's totally in keeping with how they treat their customers - as technophobe children and Apple knows what is best for them. 	human
3165	I agree and might go a step further saying it's more like a religion since belief continues when reality is pointing in the opposite direction - it takes faith to maintain belief in those conditions.  Anyway, keeping with the sports analogy. I can understand the happiness at their team winning etc. What I find crazy is that they chose him over everyone else on the team to be captain. There were 17 of them, 16 of whom were better qualified. Is is that they felt their nominees have strayed so far from the ideals of the party (and /or they were such scum) that something completely different was the best choice? Or was it simple celebrity? 	human
3166	No one has done more for literacy since JK Rowling. 	human
3167	IANAL. Reading the definitions it sounds like the swatter was guilty of reckless endangerment and the police murder 2. What interests me is the severity of the first crime is inextricably tied to the second.   The more like a kill squad the police are, the more severe the reckless endangerment. You can't say it was terrible thing to do without implicitly accepting that the police are a threat to law-abiding citizens. 	human
3168	It's this kind of experience which makes me wish I was musical. I've a couple of musical friends and they always have such a blast messing around jamming.   Keep it up, it's fun even for those of us watching from the sidelines, green with envy.	human

3170	Men and women use different strategies to exert dominance and punish their partners. Women are much more creative at being psychologically destructive towards their partner rather than physically intimidating or violent. Like we don't see psychological illness as illness, we don't see psychological abuse as abuse. A #MeToo campaign from a male perspective would probably look quite different if we did.	human
3171	It is supposed to be harder for women to secure funding from investors which is something they're not happy about.	human

3175	He makes my skin crawl before he even starts talking. *Shudder*	human
3176	Wolff doesn't strike me as someone who would take that risk on his meal ticket. He's burnt his bridges with this book and can't afford to be barred from publication because his recordings are evidence which might give Trump time to mount a defence preventing publication at a later date.   He needs the proceeds from the book and perhaps to secure a seat on the lecture circuit, no one is going to trust him again.	human
3177	Not sure, but I do know that a lot of information which is public at the time of a trail becomes personal data once the trail is over and not available. I wanted to do some analysis into the London riots looking at where the damage and fires took place compared to the neighbourhoods those convicted lived. No go.	human

3180	"Not saying that a prenup would say that. Suggesting that she'd walk away with nothing. Not a lawyer, so perhaps an arrangement that unfair could be challenged. However, if it did stand and there was a custody battle between a single mom without a job, skills or money vs an alleged billionaire, it's pretty obvious which party could provide for Barron better. Obviously it isn't going to be quite as black and white as that, but Trump would be holding most of the cards.   However, that's assuming Trump wanted Barron. From what I've read, the main reasons he'd want Barron would be to ""win"" and hurt Melania since he doesn't seem to have much in the way of positive emotions."	human
3181	"She's got these options now, but while he was just in business / TV those cards were not on the table.   As for custody, if there is a prenup, then you can absolutely see a judge giving custody to the ""billionaire"" rather than ex-wife who has basically no skills, no prospects and barely the clothes on her back - especially when he gets a top legal team who parade every topless shoot before the court and explain that she has poor moral fibre and without her husband to keep her on the straight and narrow she'll go back to her wicked ways."	human
3182	Due to the conversations here and to make sure I wasn't talking complete gibberish, I've been reading up a bit. It looks like they've made really good progress by doing things gradually. I'm going to have to visit so I can compare it to Bulgaria, which when I visited was still suffering culturally from its Communist past.	human
3183	It shouldn't be anyone's cup of tea.  Monica Belucci has chosen some interesting roles.	human
3184	I'd imagine it was one of those moments of clarity you get, you can instantly see how the future is going to unfold.   Every bit of dirt, every non-PC picture was going to be for sale and everyone will know about it, all while the chain to Trump went from being the length of the country to arm's length.  I'd need to be medicated. 	human
3185	Good news. With our negotiating team and overarching strategy, this will happen and surpass your wildest dreams.	human

3187	I had a similar experience to you when travelling through Bosnia and Serbia. I'd only ever heard bad things due to the war and that landmines might still be a risk. As far as I can tell, no landmine issues, beautiful country and lovely people.   Many of the poorer European countries are lovely because they haven't been spoilt by over-industrialisation and sprawling suburbs. If you can avoid the cheesy tourist traps, they're amazing.	human

3192	"I'd be surprised if she has that much usable dirt on him. Everyone knows how morally destitute he is, yet people continue to do business with him and people continue to support him. I doubt she has much knowledge of his business dealings outside of her monthly allowance.   What she might do is threaten divorce now, but settle terms for after his term in office to reduce his embarrassment. Waiting for him to die is probably a bad strategy, a final ""fuck you"" wouldn't be out of character even if he is as rich as he claims. "	human
3193	With Trump's public comments about women's looks, it doesn't take much imagination to think he might exercise control over someone he feels he bought and paid for who represents the evidence against his insecurities. We know he's a bully and despite first appearances, she probably doesn't have many choices.	human
3194	Wonder whose vanity it was.	human
3195	I have very slight reservations about this on both sides of the argument.   Firstly, if the animals are genuinely eaten and used for survival, it is much more acceptable.   Secondly, I think nature programs often create artificial habitats and introduce prey so that they can film a predator catching an eating it in a controlled environment. Obviously, the educational rather than entertainment motive is rather more laudable in this case.	human
3196	Ever see *Irreversible*? It's a very good film. Innovative, well acted, well directed, great lighting. I've not seen it for 8 years and have absolutely no wish to any time soon. I didn't enjoy it and would be concerned about anyone who did.	human
3197	"I'm not sure about the ""leave at any time"". It's likely that there is a prenup longer than this book which would mean that she leaves with nothing - including her son. She also knows how spiteful he is and might well make it someone's business to ruin the rest of her life.  She signed up for having occasional sex with the guy in exchange for access to a lot of money and multiple homes she she'd mostly not have to see him. She didn't sign up for ""the presidency torture"" and I don't see how she deserves it.   There is a lot of scope for her being a better First Lady, but even then you have to wonder if that is all her, or if she's not allowed to do anything that might steal Trump's limelight. "	human
3198	She lucked out on the genetic lottery and cashed in. Given where she came from, she did pretty well for herself, although I'm sure she has many regrets - including that she could have still married money, but have had a much better husband.  She made the same deal that women make every day and have done forever. While society is still so male dominated, I can't bring myself to blame her.   Imagine, you come from a poor country, make it to the US, marry an (alleged) billionaire who becomes President and still have legitimate regrets for how your life has turned out.	human
3199	There is that.  A pet theory of mine has always been that dreams act as a buffer so small changes in your environment get incorporated into your dream, but your imagination can't assimilate a large disturbance and you wake up.	human
3200	I **specifically** said that I wasn't commenting on the films.  I firmly believe that you can appreciate a film without liking it. 	human

3202	Yup. He really turned his life around.	human

3206	"This is the correct answer. Every time the White House gets caught making ridiculous claims they ""clarify"" by limiting the scope of their previous statement and pretend that everyone else is to blame for not interpreting it that way initially.

3218	"It's hard when someone you don't like for very good reasons does something awesome - especially when that awesome thing can only be done by them living down to your expectations of being a creep.  It's hard to deny that we need this kind of response. I keep thinking the media and parts of government are like the police in [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlyMZNURdmc). They're just not equipped to deal with such cynical, brutal attacks. They are playing Queensbury rules while their opponent is full on MMA. One thing the administration has worked out is where the power lies - with them. Trump is a bully who has made a career of exploiting weaker parties to ""win"".   The press corps have lost much of their power due to the increase in media channels, Trump communicating directly and undermining of any voice but his. Banning them would hurt them much more than him, so they pull their punches, not that those punches would have much behind them now that so much journalism is superficial reporting.   The press corps see their job as holding the President to account, but he's a President who doesn't put himself in a position to be held accountable, hiding behind SHS and Twitter. All that leaves them with is reporting the scraps dished out by the White House, reducing them to lapdogs who fear being put out in the cold.  I don't think we can expect more Wolff-style kamikaze attacks on Trump, you have to assume that the rest of his career is going to revolve around his book (if he needs to work again), since no one is going to trust him. Perhaps there is going to be enough blood in the water for the press to find some backbone."	human
3219	"It's one of the few things that I get savage about. There comes a point where everyone in the room knows how disingenuous someone is being with their argument, they know they can't win, so they're just throwing as much shit around hoping some of it sticks to their opponent or simply distracts from the argument.   ""I know the chilli is too hot. Some peppers are hotter than others, maybe I used the right amount and they were all super-hot, no one knows. I left it cooking for a long time, maybe someone added some more, I'm not saying they did, but you know, it happens, maybe it was Mike, maybe it was you, who knows? Anyway, you like hot chilli and it's not like I set the kitchen on fire like your stupid sister did, God rest her soul."""	human
3220	My hope is that there will be such an electoral backlash to Trump, it will allow the Dems the majorities required to break up the big telcos. A lot of the infrastructure is actually publicly owned, it's just that the telcos have monopolies about using them. The industry needs a shake-up, if they overplay their hands now, things may work out well when the revolution comes. The thing to do is to make sure that your representatives know that it is an important issue for you and that they need to come out and make where they stand on the issue clear so they can't back-track at election time when donations are appealing and promises look like a long way off.	human

3223	I'd be more surprised if he hadn't been given the questions beforehand. He's pro-Trump, so was never going to ask tough questions and wants him to perform well. Not having it all staged seems like a risk that suits nobody in the room.	human

3226	"Sorry to be pedantic. ""Denying"" would be more appropriate than ""refuting"". Refuting is proving that the opposing argument is invalid, so in this case it would be denying with evidence, ""I didn't say that at that dinner party, because here is a picture of me in another country at the time.""

3228	Yes, same reason journalists will rarely reveal confidential sources - they won't get any more confidential sources if they do.	human
3229	"I can buy that. Never thought he had a hope, so came out of the starting blocks with the first elements of a conspiracy theory that only the person who was a victim of it could be trusted to report on. Out of love of his country, he'd have to start a ""real"" news channel to combat fake news and the deep state. "	human
3230	I'd be feeling a bit of both. Thing is, if your wife always puts the car in the garage, she may have been on automatic pilot - especially with the distraction of her parents in the car. It's easy to see how it could have happened, your words simply may not have been salient until just after the critical moment.	human
3231	I wonder if playing down the roles of everyone else on the public record is going to come back and bite Trump when Mueller starts pointing the finger.	human
3232	History has probably got sufficient material for that. 	human
3233	I needs the attention. Banning him from Twitter might push him towards a medium where he can be held accountable - like a press conference. 	human
3234	"It's actually a pretty good way of people in the media and academics to post links to articles that they found interesting. Random comments about life, ""inspirational"" quotations and pictures of dinner make it less relevant."	human

3237	So our Brexit department is staffed with bright but inexperienced pro-remain graduates, many of whom are likely to be rotated out, while the EU can draw from legions of experienced civil servants from across the member states.

3238	"It does make sense if your goal is to avoid accountability. He only ever talks in the most general terms when he's not incoherently rambling about things which are off-topic. By not doing press conferences he can avoid getting asked for clarification which would require him to both have an answer and be willing to communicate it, which would open the door for criticism. Remember that this is the guy who congratulated himself for hiding the implications of the tax bill because they would be truthfully reported by the ""fake"" news to the public."	human
3239	I'd suggest you explain why in a final message. Don't pull any punches, but don't be hurtful. We appreciate people being honest, but we can be a bit petty when hurt.  The inherent distance in the relationship means it's easier. If he won't let go, then start only replying to every two messages, then every three...  I've only been dropped as a friend once. I'm pretty low maintenance, so despite her having the room next door, it took some time for me to realise that she was both ghosting and avoiding me. When the penny finally dropped, not knowing why was what really ate me up, my intuition went into overdrive without any factual information to go off so I got caught in an endless stream of self-recriminating hypotheses. It was mentally damaging. 	human
3240	The argument is that we were not in a good position when the crash came, not that it was caused by Labour.   Thatcher's deregulation of banking and subsequent governments leaving it to its own devices likely made it worse here too.	human
3241	Don't confuse the characters with the world within which they're set.  It's a patriarchal world, but that makes sense - physical ability is how you get power if you don't already have it (obviously Littlefinger is the exception to the rule). From this starting point, I think GRRM does a reasonable job. Cercei tries to take and keep power using her feminine wiles, it gets her so far, but she fails on the strategy and politics.   Dany and Arya suffer for being physically weak in a world where that's what you need to stay free. They don't simply become men with breasts to overcome that, but solve the problem in different ways.   Brienne is a tragic figure, she'd like to be feminine, but she wasn't born that way and is making the best of it after a lifetime of emotional punishment from the world.   Cat Stark unexpectedly found love in an arranged marriage and was devoted to her family while having to cope with a bastard and a ward.  It would have been nice if GRRM could dig a little more into these characters, but they're quite a varied and rich bunch. Saying that rape was the catalyst for the character is doing them a disservice. It's something that some of them have overcome rather than made them what they are.  Sansa is just annoying.	human

3243	"Yes, he seems to be disconnected from the fear and pain his actions cause. He clearly knows what he's doing is wrong, but (like many politicians) only sees the consequences of getting caught as the reason for not doing what he's doing. It's good news that they've caught him, he needs to be locked away to protect the public.   The wider point remains though, that swatting should never have become a thing. Special Weapons And Tactics seems to be ""bigger guns and straight through the door."" That is kind of ""special"". Part of tactics should be assessing the situation - that should include whether a crime is being committed. The fact that the police can be used as a weapon against law-abiding citizens like this, shows that there is something very wrong with policing."	human

3245	I don't see how it can be possible to have a working system which can defend itself against this scale of regulatory capture in league with all three branches of government. You have to reply of the civil servants to follow procedure, the checks and balances and their judgement about how well to facilitate attacks on the electorate.   I think they're doing a reasonable job.	human
3246	Thanks. Yes, that looks likely.	human
3247	What software?	human
3248	The problem is that's it's kind of self-referential. The call has a baseline of wrongness because it's going to waste police resources and frighten people. After that, the wrongness of the call increases with the likelihood that the SWAT team acts with lethal negligence (and the caller's knowledge of that likelihood).  IANAL, but from a logical standpoint, I can only see the guy being convicted of manslaughter or murder if it is accepted that SWAT is basically a dumb weapon	human

3251	"Hate to say it, but I think it's your fault.   She asked you if something was wrong, something was wrong and you said, ""Nothing"" and then were evasive. That built the issue up for her, engaged her curiosity, made her want to make you feel better and then you hit her with it being her that was the problem. If you want to upset a girl, you'll find that in a masterclass textbook.   You essentially created the kind of scene you'd find in a by the numbers romcom, put her in the starring role and when she played her part (girls dream of being in this kind of situation), when she'd worn you down she thought you were going to open up in a meaningful way to bring you closer together, you punched her in the face.  You should have simply said that you need time to yourself occasionally on the first question.  Reading when walking with others and telling her you wouldn't talk to her again were mistakes. The first is rude and childish, the second will simply damage the relationship. It's not something she'll forget.  Our problem is often that we are too logical and honest. You actually need to be more like that. Set expectations, tell people that you get irritable if you don't get some alone-time to collect your thoughts. People find us mysterious and unpredictable enough without adding to it by being evasive. "	human
3252	Yes.	human
3253	Calling an argument stupid is still name-calling.   Actually, I was putting the argument in its strongest possible terms while being ironic. It's obvious that Trump isn't the healthiest President ever, but he's called himself that. The point is, that even if we say for a moment that we believe all of this BS he's been spouting, he has still done something wrong - in fact, if you believe his BS, it's more wrong.	human
3254	"That's just name-calling. Anyone can call any argument fucking stupid, just as someone might call some reporting they disagree with ""fake news"". It's trying to dismiss an argument out of hand. No one who doesn't already hold your position is going to be convinced. Better to treat it seriously and show it doesn't hold water, or do the same with irony."	human

3261	Perhaps you should read more than the first sentence of a comment before going on the offensive.   Take a moment and *breathe*.	human
3262	Reread my comment. It isn't complimentary.   Most arguments which defend Trump's actions do not stand up to scrutiny and potentially dig the hole deeper. In this case, either Trump has lied in his tweet, or he is conducting Government business without advice or a record of the conversation. It's also a very inefficient means of conducting business.	human

3268	A lot of business is done on the golf course. Can it be confirmed that these are official meetings? If they are, is there some requirement for the parties to be recorded and minutes taken?   One does have to wonder at what important negotiations POTUS is conducting with a couple of golf professionals and the Senator of Georgia.   If this was recreation (perish the thought!), then a news network is absolutely in the right to expose lies. Being generous for a moment, I don't think anyone would argue that the healthiest, most hard-working President in history is entitled to some R&amp;R, but he shouldn't be pretending his bosses that he's working.  It might be argued that it's inconsequential, a white lie. However, if he's willing to lie about something so small, it casts doubt on his other claims such as the size of crowds, whether he is wealthy, whether he has assaulted women etc etc.	human
3269	Yes, but it's a bit different. Played in the shower and it's one hole and 18 players. Same principles apply. Start with a good drive...	human

Both sexes need to be able to make a sexual overture (even a clumsy one), without repercussions of more than the embarrassment of rejection.

You don't know what kind of reception you'll get until you make a move, so it's unfair of society to only permit welcome advances (on the first occasion anyway!)	human

3282	"Not my call to make, but if it were, I'd be wanting to give her every reasonable chance for success. My instinct was that this was pushing the bounds of ""reasonable"".   She is quite junior and probably only about 24, so I was surprised that she was that she was unwilling to learn the differences or that she wasn't reasonably comfortable already with Windows since it's pretty unavoidable."	human
3283	Getting some of my info second-hand, so not sure about this one. I'm working with her soon and will find out. I hope this is the case, I'd like there to be more of a reason than aesthetics.	human
3284	That's a narrow view. There is going to be cost incurred somewhere, either that's in the designer working her way up the learning curve, or the cost spread across departments within the business to cater for her preference. The question is where is it best to place the cost to minimise it and maximise the up-side.   We've accommodated (partly because she said she can't work on anything but a Mac, which is not true from a practical perspective) to give her the best start. When I heard, it struck me that she was rather over-stating her case, which people here have confirmed.	human
3285	It struck me as a sign of inflexibility saying that she can't work with a PC. These things are give and take, we can't expect someone to use their own equipment, so we've got her what she wants. She painted it as a show-stopper which I thought was over-stating the case from a practical perspective, which people here have confirmed. If your personal preference is sufficiently strong, then that also constitutes a show-stopped, but that's not how the case was presented.	human
3286	It's non-standard IT equipment, so it's outside the normal procurement process, there are some questions about how well it'll play with our infrastructure, two-factor authentication etc etc  Nothing insurmountable, but it's creating extra work for busy people to cater for personal preference. I'd prefer to use Linux, but I don't / can't for the reasons above.	human
3287	Thanks for your input. I've been following tutorials for years which cater for both OSs and only ever noticed that small shortcut difference and was fine when I used a Mac myself.   I had a sudden worry that I was doing her a disservice and there was something supercharged about the Mac workflow I wasn't appreciating. Cheers! 	human
3288	This is what I thought. I get the impression that she doesn't feel like a designer when using PC laptop and that's her real objection. Hopefully all will be well now, slightly concerned that it's a red flag signalling future problems.	human
3289	Everyone who is associated with the situation knows this. The Government has been forced into taking people rather than helping them in situ by the press who casually dismiss our efforts in the ground and focus on the number of people/families we've taken in. It's not difficult to argue that the press have caused suffering and death by making it politically unacceptable not to take more people from these regions rather spending money in these regions.	human
3290	They kind of had to be. Education was controlled by or heavily influenced by the Church and all institutions were too. That means you start with a strongly indoctrinated set of thinkers from the start.  Great minds which didn't at least find a way to make room for God were either killed, not published, censored, self-censored or sidelined. Before the printing press, ideas were very fragile. To go to the effort of transcribing something would require you to really value it, so there were few copies of documents and they are easily lost to history. We've been robbed of their contributions, not that they didn't make, or at least want to make, contributions. 	human

3327	Agreed. Justice would be to let them keep assets equivalent to someone in the bottom 5% of the population somewhere in a red state heartland and let them see how easy life is under their policies. I bet that most wouldn't be able to find employment. 	human
3328	Trump's supporters dearly need them discredited. You try to get ahead of the story by calling them unlawful now and then start throwing justifications at the issue hoping something will stick.	human
3329	You mean they didn't get them through the proper Russian channels? Tsk tsk.	human
3330	Surprise. But at least we could constantly raise the issue for the next year as if there were something in there and blame an investigation and investigator we had initially whole-heartedly supported like petulant children. Or would that be disingenuous and tacky?	human
3331	Even better was how Trump asked the President of Mexico not to tell anyone that Mexico wasn't going to pay for the wall because it would make him look bad.  Such a negotiator!	human
3332	No, but it is a pet theory to which I subscribe.	human
3333	I'd hope the UK dosn't follow suit - there isn't the same obsession with free markets, hence a moderately competitive ISP market. You never know though, media and communications do seem to have a sway on policy.  Startups are going to be at huge risk.   It's going to be interesting how it all plays out. Given that they may only have a few years to profit from the ruling because the Dems will make the restoration a priority, it wouldn't be too surprising if the ISPs tried to make maximum profits. If they were foolish enough to do that as an oligopoly, the Dems might be in a position to break them up and take away their stranglehold on the infrastructure, allowing new entrants into the market. If they managed that, even if the Republicans took away neutrality again, the forces of a better functioning market would limit the damage - people would simply not subscribe to providers who limited their services. So, there are some faint silver linings.	human
3334	Went there to get the other side of the argument. That sub is full of so much hate. Their reaction to this is all about point-scoring and upsetting people they hate.  They did have a point that some of the attacks against Pai are racist. Need to watch that to avoid being easily discredited. 	human
3335	The EU are pretty good about consumer protection, it's the UK that should be worried as the default assumption is that the US is the model to follow.	human
3336	The attitudes in the room were in such stark contrast. These two had such pent up anger and frustration, everyone else was all light-hearted smuggery.	human
3337	95% of the reports I read about the tsetse are negative. Impartial doesn't mean balanced.  CNN were never going to be a fan of Trump, but just because they were always going to be hard to impress, it doesn't mean that them reporting on the terrible and incompetent things his administration get up to is wrong. 	human
3338	I'd guess that you have agencies who handle counterterrorism. What does he benefit from them? Nothing. Building a massive great wall, lots of private contractors, plenty of opportunity for profit.	human

To use a crude example, people don't bat an eye at a woman in the workplace, but are suspicious of a man in the playground.  It's good that we are seeing a change in views for one gender (although God knows there is a long way to go), but guys are pulling the short straw in many areas of equality.	human

3348	"I doubt we will see a reverse. What we're seeing to some extent in the ""professionalisation"" (apologies if that's not a word!) of jobs. This means vocational jobs such as nursing require a degree (and yet don't attract the salary of a traditional profession). I see this as dangerous, as it loads people up with debt while preventing them from working full time for years - but that's another discussion.  I'd argue that there is a societal element going on here too. As a gent, I feel pressured to take a career path which will maximise my earnings because there is an expectation that while my significant other may or may not be full-time employed, I will be responsible for financial security. I accept that this is a view open to challenge. However, if we do accept it for a moment, we can see that the result would be that assuming women are in a long-term relationship, or plan to be in one, the pressure is off them to get on a high-paying career path and can choose one which is more balanced with personal rewards. That would tally with the aspirations shown by this study and why men go to jobs already loaded with men and vice versa.  Personally, I'd like to do a more creative/artistic job where I was working in a more diverse environment. I love working with women and my best managers have all been women. However, I'm doing a more lucrative role working with numbers and guys. Life's not bad, I'm happy, but the grass looks greener and I feel that I have been manoeuvred to this side of the fence by social mores. "	human

3351	Apparently I wasn't clear. I use an aeropress and have done for over a year at work. I see other people try to make real coffee with a variety of other products - usually based around a french press design, but cleaning those are a hassle and after the novelty has worn off they switch back to instant.   I keep using my aeropress because it makes great coffee and is almost self-cleaning. Can't fault it.	human
3352	Which is why I really hope there is a conviction made - both for justice and so that there is no wriggle-room for his supporters.	human
3353	I keep seeing people at work try gizmos like diddy french presses or french presses which double as a cup. They don't last beyond a week or two because they are such a faff to clean. I wish I worked somewhere with fancy espresso machines, I'd probably use them as I think you get marginally better coffee out of them. As it is, I'm happy, no fuss, no mess.   Going to make some coffee now!	human
3354	Which is a shame because if you ever enter the business world you'll see that slide templates haven't moved on since the 1990s and with a bit of graphic design knowledge people could write reports and presentations that people would actually read, be able to absorb and make informed decisions from. 	human
3355	I think part of this is the operating system. I tend to use Linux which is a close cousin of the Mac OS and that vastly extends the life of my PC laptops.	human

3362	"I think they felt he'd tweet something very inappropriate when he woke up. By getting a gracious tweet from his account out there, he'd be less likely to rant about voter fraud, conspiracies and investigations because he will see that the message is playing well with the press and he might be reluctant to contradict ""himself""."	human
3363	Weren't they going to destroy ballot records?	human
3364	If you apply Trumpemathics to it, then there are at least that many votes for Moore and most of Jones's votes are fraudulent. 	human
3365	I'd say not. They thought they had it locked. I'd say they were in a rush because they didn't want a lot of discussion about a bill that is going to hurt a lot of people in a lot of different ways. There's only so much airtime for analysis and discussion, push it through quickly and only 10 of the 106* ever get aired.  *numbers for illustration	human
3366	It would be a hypocritical, morally bankrupt decision to count them now. I believe it would be legal, they vote wasn't to destroy them, but to not require keeping them. Obviously, they should be kept in the event of fraud being suspected, but they've made their bed and should have to lie in it. Perhaps then they'll make the right decision and keep ballots next time the issue is examined.	human

3373	"Absolutely.   It's just a shame that it's a crime where there is rarely evidence one way or the other this far from the crime (even if he does look dodgy AF). About the best we can hope for is that society will be less tolerant of this and women feel more able to report it. Perhaps if enough people come forward, the combined weight of evidence will be enough, one way or the other.  Clearly the allegations made are very serious and if it happened, it was assault. From other reporting though, it does make me concerned that there is a danger that unwanted sexual advances are being blown up to being harassment. You don't know for sure how your advances will be received until you make them. If a hand on a knee or a bum gets spun as ""groping"" which can come back to haunt you years later to sell newspapers, we're all screwed."	human
3374	You should care whether it is forgery in the sense of the word forgery though. It's the difference between her making it all up and arguing about the finer details. It's clear that she isn't making it all up and that there is a case to answer.	human

3378	If you look at the picture, it's obvious that the date and location are in a different hand, but the initial comment and his signature are in the same hand. What she's written doesn't make the rest a forgery.   If you believe the date and location she wrote is inaccurate, you might argue that she could be trying misrepresent the context of what he wrote, but that is very different from forgery.	human
3379	To be fair, the same is true of everyone's first impressions. It seems likely that Fox did it intentionally making the entire article about it, CNN did it as an oversight which would have misled careful readers. That the CNN journalist is facing disciplinary measures for the lesser transgression tells you something about the integrity of the organisations. 	human
3380	"I can see this happening.   The GOP will see that the writing is on the wall and won't get anything more out of him, they'll choose one of the many bits of dirt clinging to him to officially recognise, seize the moral high-ground, claim that, ""He was never really one of us, he was in fact a Democrat, look at this picture of him with the Clintons."" Fox will be all surprised and disappointed that he's bad, but they were never really on his side, a president with Democratic leanings who has had lacklustre turnouts from his inauguration onwards..."	human
3381	Her logic is that it is perfectly ok and if you happen to get caught, then because you believe in the rule of law, you pay the fine.  She doesn't seem to appreciate that that is the sociopath's view, that the fine is there to prevent people from speeding because it's dangerous. Fines are simply an occupational hazard. Kind of speaks to the outlook of her clique. 	human
3382	I'm sure I was taught that this was done at the sacking of Carthage...	human
3383	They sure as hell will now. The Dems have set a dangerous precedent for themselves, forcing someone out over unproven accusations. This time it's a safe seat, next time when it's a political attack, it'll be somewhere contested. What then? The story is no longer about a transgression, but about whether the Dems are disingenuous about their espoused ethics because they've established that where there's smoke, there's fire (even if the Republicans are standing right there with torches and pitchforks). 	human
3384	The branches all need to be growing up in the same direction on both sides of the bow :)	human
3385	It was right though. Many people didn't like Clinton and they didn't like Trump either, so they were left voting for the person they felt was least repugnant (and sadly many people hadn't had the misfortune to know Trump well enough). The problem was that the debate never went further than personalities because people were interested in the knots Hilary was tied up in with her emails and Trump couldn't talk about what he didn't have / understand / remember, so stuck to incoherent rambling which somehow played well with many voters.   If South Park failed, it failed in showing that the election wasn't *just* about whether to elect the giant douche or turd sandwich (because it was about that), but what their parties would do was also important.	human

3388	You could figure out how to create a diagram of your interests, how they overlap and where the things you want which support the interest lie on the map (with a handy price banding and key to an internet link). Or just a list ;) You should still list your hobbies and interests to remind her and help spark some creativity if she wants to go off-script.  I create a list of lots of things that I'd like at all price ranges and enjoy the surprise of what actually turns up. I don't like the transactional approach of a small list of things I expect.	human

3391	Once you complete a tutorial, make the code your own. Start tinkering with it. Change colours, add scores, get data from the internet, save progress, create logs to compare games. Programming is about being creative and you can't learn that from following a recipe. Use the tutorial as a foundation to build on and you'll learn so much more. Then, build something similar from scratch.	human
3392	Just don't go too far with putting things on the video! It's useful to be able read the more complicated bits at your own pace, broken up by your drawings which help learning and keep interest. The video as a worked example is the icing on the cake - but it's also likely the bit people will see once, so it needs some scaffolding for the uninitiated and a reference back to your written post. That's where I'd draw the line between the post and the article, but that's just my personal preference.  I'm from the UK, so on the one hand, getting Monty Python references is playing on easy, on the other hand, I think they lock people up in the Tower of London for missing them!	human

3397	No one else wants that poisoned chalice.   Even if she did everything right, the EU would still have far more negotiators and negotiation power than us - that's the frigging point of the EU. That we have a PM who is good at climbing the greasy pole, but terrible at doing the work of an MP or PM simply compounds the issue.	human
3398	I don't know opentoonz. I'd prefer Inkscape for line art because its vector.  If you're not good at drawing, get a pad of paper and a pencil. Go to youtube and do some tutorials and then practice with quick draw games. Then practice with drawing random stuff you see as you watch tv. Then practice as you eat your lunch. Seeing a pattern? :)  You need to get ok at drawing, then get a tablet. You can slowly manipulate lines into shape that you've drawn with a mouse, but it will take so much longer than if you can draw and ink using a few, confident strokes.	human
3399	I'd guess the fees are an effect of it being used for investment. If you're expecting a 400% return for just holding onto the currency, then you'll be willing to accept fees which would make someone wanting to buy a $20 item decide decide against the purchase.   If the speculation side took a large hit, I'd expect transaction costs to drop to encourage more people back.   Don't know about the speed. Magic?	human

3401	Hi, in case that's Chelsea, I'd suggest adding a touch more to your video. Your site is really engaging and a video example in R is a great idea, but you should cater for people who come across the video on its own. Simply give a one sentence introduction to MANOVA and each of the test stats and refer people back to your website (but only give the address once in the video).	human

3418	We can act in confusing ways to other people due to both being thorough and having a strong internal moral code. So we might help someone because it costs us little and will help them a lot and then we'll go a tiny bit further to finish the job so we have closure and ensure that our standards have been met. To an outsider, we have just been incredibly selfless and helped them out enormously. I don't know about you, but I am terrible at using that social capital and am usually off doing my next thing leaving that person feeling confused and frustratingly indebted.   Relationships of all sorts need to be reciprocal and both sides need to see the balance. The trick is to keep things reciprocal without making them transactional.   I think you should ask this girl for help with something to allow her to pay you back. For example, if it were me, I'm interested in digital art and graphic design, but I'm not great at sketching. If she is a bit artistic, I'd ask her to sketch some shapes and characters on a page that then I'd scan and work up into a design. That kind of personal request, asking for their time and creativity that only they have is both flattering and gives her the chance to give back and will strengthen the friendship.	human

3422	I liked that the EU was guaranteeing a modicum of privacy, liberty and little things like being able to use my mobile phone outside of the country without having to give Vodafone my firstborn. Our PM is currently our greatest threat to free speech.  The closer knit security agencies should help prevent terrorism, any distancing is likely to make us more at risk.   We could have enacted measures to limit immigration, but in our wisdom, decided not to.   There's a lot wrong with the EU, but there's a lot more wrong about leaving it. The only way I can see us benefiting from losing our trade deals, freedom of movement, regulatory protection, shared research projects and international judicial system, is that the EU falls apart. That doesn't seem to be happening unless Catalonia gets much more interesting. 	human
3423	I'd suggest keeping your R learning separate from Tableau to start with for the same reason as I wouldn't recommend using a front end to R when learning - they'll act as a crutch that will be difficult to throw away. Instead use the RStudio IDE and follow an beginners R course. I did the Coursera one from Johns Hopkins. It's not perfect, but was good (and I understand they've improved it since I did it).   As you do the course you'll have ideas of how to use it with Tableau and can experiment, but you won't build up a dependency on Tableau.	human
3424	I would be looking for quality of analysis and how sophisticated and appropriate the visualisations were. I wouldn't give a toss about where it was hosted. I don't want a data scientist handling sys admin tasks, I've got cheaper resources for that. It's not a core skill and not an area I'd want them getting bogged down in. More skills are better, but things would have to be very close for this to be the deciding factor.	human
3425	He's given his endorsement to Moore. What more does anyone need?	human
3426	That's how I tend to use it if I've not been given a specific task. It's great for exploring datasets. If I've got a lot of variables, I'll use R and loop through to compare everything against everything, but in most business contexts Tableau is ideal for getting an overall understanding of what's going on in a dataset.   I'd say that it's up there as a best tool for your purpose, a couple of desktop licenses and you're flying. Once you start needing their server though, it's time for some hard decisions to be made, it can become a very expensive hobby at that point. I've not seen many proposals for server which would I'd say give a solid return on investment.	human

3431	"Some points:  * Trump is absolutely making shit up. Everything from the size of crowds to having signed more bills than any other President to proof of Obama's ""real"" birthplace, to ""last night in Sweden"", to claims that America is the highest taxed nation in the world. * When Rex Tillerson called Trump a ""fucking moron"", Trump responded by challenging him to an IQ test. That's pretty moronic.  * An alleged sexual offender calling out other alleged sexual offender does not get to have the moral high ground. * Trump has brought in exactly the kind of people he was criticising on the campaign trail, it's almost like he used LinkedIn to get a list of people who have a background with the likes of Goldman Sachs to create his shortlist. Then his other choices like Betsy DeVos - what she lacks in experience, she makes up for in vested interests. He's not draining the swamp, but displacing it by pumping in toxic waste.  Trump and the Republican party are doing so much heinous shit right now it is like there are 1000 lasers. It may be entertaining to watch the cat jump around, but they're burning down the house with both of you inside - and you're laughing. "	human
3432	I have similar hopes, but am concerned that due to control of the courts, gerrymandering and the mental gymnastics so many Trump supporters seem to manage, the swing may not happen - or at least not nearly to the extent which it should. 	human
3433	"That's the simplistic beauty of what he's doing. If you don't go out, it is one in the eye for Democrats (they don't care about the actual implications). You go out and protest and Republicans clap their hands with glee watching you ""lose your shit"", which makes him popular. Also, it distracts attention from the other heinous things they're up to."	human
3434	"That's pretty harsh. I can understand where you're coming from, but you give an extreme example. It is certainly an INTJ thing to think that leading badly is grounds for not leading and the replacement should be made as swiftly as possible to protect the objective. However, I certainly wouldn't sit back and watch things going to hell in a handbasket without trying to change the course of action. I'd consult, persuade and explain. If that got ignored, then I'd start thinking about my options of A, B, C and do nothing. I would put my interests high on the priority list, but also my friends on the project, the use of the project and how much I wanted to see the guy in charge reap what he'd sewn (I'm not a fan of being ignored).  I hate it it when people tell me to do things without explanation, so unless it was an absolute emergency, I'd never pull a ""You're doing it wrong, move."" If I were forced, then I'd explain afterwards.   ENTJs are often natural leaders, but I often see them run into obvious walls in their enthusiasm to get things and people moving."	human

3436	He's not really a Republican President. It's insane how messed up this is. The President is only out for himself and the billionaires he sees as his peers, the Republican Party seem to have given up Republicanism and are now simply against anything the Democrats propose and their voters treat their affiliation as part of their identity, so any rational debate is impossible, while they take extreme pleasure at upsetting Democrats irrespective of the cause. Where are the Republicans who believe in Republicanism? 	human

That's not a bad thing, everyone's got to start somewhere and you can get a lot out of eye-balling your data with the right visualisations, filters and drill-downs.   You're right about the functionality, Tableau is in fact more limited than R, but it is way faster to throw something together than R. Also, being able to overlap elements in Tableau is pretty useful whereas R is constrained to the bootstrap layouts in shiny.   The main problem I see with Tableau is the tail wags the dog. It's ""let's show this data in a cool attractive way"" not ""What questions do I need to answer and what combination of visuals and filters will allow me to answer them?""

Last year someone did an analysis of Jurassic Park and noted that it was a celebration of achievement. Literally everyone in that film was the best in their field. Ok, one character acted selfishly due to a character flaw, but even he was good at his job. Ellie Sadler wasn't just along for the ride as a sidekick, she was an expert in her area and even Lexie's nerdy tendencies were celebrated and played a vital role in their survival.

3484	Use it all the time in multiple businesses. Only have had real problems where security is super-tight and any new software has to go through an expensive process for approval, so not an open source issue.  Where I have been confronted by an ignorant IT function, then my response has been to gently give them a reality check. Always best to try to get them on your side, praising them for being suspicious of what seems to be niche software, but actually within it's field it is very mature and used by companies such as Google, Amazon, Uber and Microsoft. Note that Microsoft have integrated it into SQL Server. That's usually enough to persuade them that it is mainstream and ok.  If that doesn't work, I start to bring it. I'll ask them to list their objections and reply countering each one. I'll also find some software they have on their estate and see if it stands up to the same list of objections, look at the license agreement for that software and point out that the agreement means they don't have a leg to stand on if the software doesn't perform, so they're no worse off with R which should not be held to a higher standard.   If I still don't get any traction, then I list my requirements for using R and ask them to come up with a solution which allows me to do my job and satisfies their security concerns. As a support function they need to facilitate business, not prevent it. Senior people cced. I might reiterate that big companies and government departments use it and ask them to provide examples of R causing damage to businesses which are comparable to those done by malicious Excel macros. R is less of a risk than Excel, they have Excel installed, so R must be an acceptable risk. 	human

3486	I'd imagine falling birthrates have more to do with contraception, increasing distractions like Netflix, improved communications making work seep into home life, changes to the types of job people have and people putting off having children until later which decreases their actively fertile period.   Personally, I'd say the problem is poor social mobility. Through bad luck people do fall into a pool referred to as scroungers, lazy feckless and worse. That's not to say that many people in it are not scroungers, lazy, feckless and worse. If you're born into poverty, then you have to be exceptional and lucky to climb out as all of the easy options will keep you there. If you see the people who try, consistently fail, then the only sensible alternative is not to try. Why make an effort when at best it'll get you nothing more that those who don't bother and it might push you down further?	human
3487	Identity cards are a thorny issue. I was really trying to say that the only times I ever saw other European countries mentioned was when we were at the bottom of a league table so we could do some hand-wringing and self-flagellation and even then there was nothing about how other countries would do things better.   Our press should have been holding our government to account when we were at the bottom of tables and asking why we weren't doing what different countries were and finding where different countries were flouting or capturing regulations to benefit them. Instead, we got phone hacking because it was it was a cheap way to get sensationalist headlines while journalists who were capable of proper reporting were let go.	human

3498	Build in flexibility. If everyone wants a different front-end, then let them have it, just standardise the transactions and data held to the core system. The are going to be some areas where there is mutual exclusivity, so you have someone with a big stick for those situations, but a late customisation model would, for me, allow the flexibility different Trusts wanted and drive innovation as developers try to create the best and most intuitive bed allocation app or prescription app. 	human
3499	The NHS should be leading the charge with Linux or at the very least a cross-platform open architecture. They aren't going anywhere so could build an ecosystem of small companies around it to fix bugs and develop applications.

3500	I'm not sure you can blame someone for not being able to see into the future, even if she is Margaret Thatcher.  The problem I see with Connecting For Health is that they went for a monolithic solution. What would have been more sensible is to have a common core with defined inputs so the Trusts could adapt and develop their own solutions. There would have to be some standardisation, there is an overlapping mishmash of specialties for example, but nothing that is fundamentally unsolvable.   Should probably have started with a single Trust and gone from there. Like you said, too many middle managers allowed to tweak specifications and dismal IT project management.	human

3517	By that definition, almost everyone is half-educated, but the article only throws the accusation at the technical side.  What's really changed is that in a few exceptional cases, innovators have been able to capture the value they have created. In the past only the rich could capitalise on the ideas of innovators as the cost of infrastructure was so great. If university educated at all, that elite wouldn't study dirty subjects like engineering, it would be humanities. However, I don't believe that they did much hand-wringing about the number of people who died building their bridges and ships, or that that those ships were warships.   We do see the tech world serving up new tools and releasing them into the wild. Often they're put out as a minimum viable product, so if your product only just works, you can image how much deep thought has been put into the societal impact.   The humanities are massively underfunded compared to sciences and this reflects the importance Western culture puts on them due to our capitalist mentality. However, I don't see that having an innovator lead his or her own company as a bad thing, the low barrier to entry means tech is one of the few areas which can be a meritocracy promoting social mobility.   It is questionable whether technical specialists make good businessmen, some do, some don't. I've known a few who would be much happier if they gave day-to-day running to someone else so they could pursue their passion which made their company successful, but they can't let go of control. The classic entrepreneur's mistake.	human
3518	"I was making a general point that people insulate themselves from criticism by taking on the mantle of victimhood.

3530	You're welcome.  I think Life start off at a disadvantage due to guilt by association with the stereotypical hate-filled American protesters who harass people at clinics. Generally people can't get past that and start having a proper discussion.  From hearing the person I know speak, our current approach to an unwanted pregnancy is to smooth the way to an abortion that leaves the mother without regret or mental damage, making the tough decision to keep it or give it up for adoption is only given a nod. Perhaps that course of action is better for the mother, the father and society - even sufficiently so to kill a viable foetus. I'd like that decision to be the result of a vigorous debate, not by a thousand little steps which take us somewhere which seems inevitable.   Politicians like to talk about British Values and I think that pro-choice is best for society. However, no one has signed up for pro-abortion which seems to be where the path of least resistance leads. No one is brave enough to open that can of worms, or they are happy with the status quo.  Life do help a lot of women and it's hard to fault their approach that killing babies is wrong, and even coming from a narrow religious standpoint, they don't discriminate between the ones they try to save. I see it as a bunch of people trying hard to do the right thing without hurting others.	human

They can provide somewhere to live for women who are given an ultimatum by their families or significant other, ""Get an abortion or get out."" By being there, Life gives them a choice.  It is tied up with pretty fervent Catholicism, but I guess it takes people with very strong views to get off their arses and refurbish houses, scrub toilets and deal with hysterical women at 2am in the morning as well as putting their hands in their pockets.   It's far from perfect, but I can't bring myself to throw any stones at it."	human

3543	The likes of CA will likely have contacts with all parties, if not have personal friends in them. Obama won his original campaign partly due to mobilising social media. That campaign would have targeted people and which message to give which people. A difference is that he was generally appealing to people's better angels whereas the nationalism that we saw in Brexit and the US election certainly didn't. That said, it was still more positive than the Remain campaign. 	human

3551	I'm pretty tightly wound and find it difficult to loosen up.   I find it hard to transition from the transactional question and answers to the free flowing fun small talk. True, small talk doesn't interest me much, but it's essential for social interactions and I wish I were better at it. I find I often drop the conversational ball, having nothing to say - usually because I am over-thinking where the conversation might go and all of a sudden I need to say something and my scumbag brain goes blank.   I push myself into such situations for practice. Sometimes it works out. When I can stop analysing everything and just live in the moment, things flow much more easily.   In group situations I tend to have lots of one to one conversations. I hadn't noticed that was my behaviour, but a friend pointed out that I will go around the entire group and have a chat with each person rather engage in the group conversation.

3554	"It's the non-technical arguments which are going to win this for you. Throwing around big brand names who use it or who are associated with it will give confidence. The IT department is clearly afraid - likely because they're not very good, know it and don't want to risk opening the door to something that will expose it. Sadly that means that they will not be sufficiently technically able to do the kinds of tests which would disprove their fears.   This licensing issue is another red herring. Any license will have a clause like this one from Microsoft:  &gt; What if the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft, breaches any part of this agreement? &gt; EXCEPT FOR A NY REFUND THE MA NUFACTURER OR INSTALLER, OR MICROSOFT, MAY &gt; PROVIDE, YOU MAY NOT RECOVER A NY OTHER DAMA GES, INCL UDING DIRECT, &gt; CONSEQUENTIA L, LOST PROFITS, SPECIA L, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTA L DAMA GES. Thedamage exclusions and limitations in this agreement apply even if repair, replacement or a refund for the &gt; software does not fully compensate you for any losses or if the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft, &gt; knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. SOME STA TES A ND COUNTRIES &gt; DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITA TION OF INCIDENTA L, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR &gt; OTHER DA MA GES, SO THOSE LIMITA TIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF &gt; YOUR LOCAL LAW ALLOWS YOU TO RECOVER OTHER DAMA GES FROM THE MA NUFA CTURER &gt; OR INSTALLER, OR MICROSOFT, EVEN THOUGH THIS A GREEMENT DOES NOT, YOU CA NNOT &gt; RECOVER MORE THA N YOU PA ID FOR THE SOFTWARE.  You aren't going to find any knock-down rebuttals to their arguments as they are based on the miasma of fear Microsoft and others have been propagating for years. All you can do is provide confidence that it is mainstream analytics software used by respected brands and to argue that R should not be held to a higher standard than software already on the estate. In this case, yes it is a risk that there is no one to sue if R misbehaves. However, there is an implicit assumption that a big-name backed licensed application will allow legal remedies. To be fair the question needs to be rephrased, ""Is R more of a risk than other software on the estate because there is no one to sue?"" The license agreement with MS shows that you'll only get the cost of the software off them, no consequential damages. So that's the same as you get for R.   Don't let them deal in absolutes, that's what will kill you. It isn't ""Is it safe?"" (no, it's not safe, nothing is), but ""Is it less safe than software that has already been approved?"" That way they either have to admit that they have a terrible security policy, that they can't follow a reasonable security policy, or that R is ok to be on the estate."	human
3555	Perhaps they've heard of a little outfit called Microsoft which bought the business commercialising R - Revolution Analytics. They might have come across a niche product of theirs SQL server which has R integrated for analysis or Azure which has a machine learning lab which is specifically built to allow R to be used. Then there are the organisations using R, from the FDA to Google to UBER to eBay. What does your IT department know that those organisations don't?  If IT have a genuine concern that messages might be being sent, then why don't they test it in a sandboxed environment? Or since it's open source, look at the source code? Can't do that with proprietary software.  Alternatively they could set up a closed environment with R and all the packages you think you'd need installed and devise a means of securely importing and exporting data.  I don't believe that there is any evidence of R or any of its packages secretly sending data back to developers, but there is for [Microsoft Windows](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2978239/windows/microsoft-slips-user-tracking-tools-into-windows-7-8-amidst-windows-10-privacy-storm.html). It isn't something that R does, and if did, it would be no worse than software currently on their estate. What is the security case for holding a single instance of R to a higher standard than software which is on every machine?  In summary, R is industry standard software used by world-leading organisations with mature IT departments for core business tasks; it's even built into cutting edge Microsoft products. There is evidence that Windows sends data to MS, there is not evidence that R does, therefore how can they justify using Windows and not R? It's not surprising that IT haven't heard of R, just as it isn't surprising that they won't have heard of naive bayse classification - it's not their job, it's yours. It is their job to facilitate and enable business operations. Yours is a new function to provide new value and it is not unreasonable that it has new requirements. If they have security concerns, it is their job to either satisfy themselves through testing that something is safe or not, or provide an environment to mitigate the risk. 	human

However to avoid an insta-lawsuit it has to be a bit different, so there are regular Family Guy comedy moments. What does that leave us with? Star Trek with toilet and cringe humour. It's a weird combination of wanting to be taken seriously when moralising in the earnest, Star Trek way, then wanted to be laughed at when it's the next character's turn to act like a tool for comic effect. For me neither works. Star Trek doesn't need remaking, even if you can get Jonathan Frakes to do some directing. 	human
3572	That's really interesting, I didn't know the history of why Apple was used more by designers before the iMac made Apple cool.   My world is business consulting and use Inkscape mainly for graphs and diagrams as well as more artistic things if I think I can justify it.Being able to add obviously tailored graphics to presentations impresses my clients. Sometimes I have to use their systems and the free nature of Inkscape means I can often do so. That means that I can only engage a pro like yourself when I've got a really complicated design you can get your teeth into.  When it comes to it, if you put Adobe's software side by side with GIMP and Inkscape, Adobe's wins by a country mile. The resources they've thrown at the products over the years will dwarf anything that GIMP and Inkscape have had at their disposal for obvious reasons. However, it is an unfair comparison due to price and availability. I think it is an astounding achievement that both GIMP and Inkscape are sufficiently mature that I don't have to give a second thought in dismissing Adobe's offerings as not worth the price.	human

Why are you all not using illegal software?""   There are many reasons, one of which you might find out if your game is successful enough for Adobe to decide it's worth their time to take all of your assets.  Linux desktop is very mature now, it's unlikely that Linux is actually stopping you from moving from Windows. Anyway, the whole point is moot since Inkscape runs very nicely on Windows.  To wrap up. Of course everyone will recommend Illustrator. It is the industry standard package, dominant in the market and is a very good, usable program. Inkscape is free and very good, but not as good as Illustrator for obvious reasons. Whether you illegally use Illustrator and risk prosecution, or take a little time to learn Inkscape. Your justifications are nonsense. "	human

3632	I had planned on an L-shaped desk with an additional extension, but they were all too costly or in difficult places to pick up. Instead I ended up going for a tempered glass diningroom table. It has slide-out wings and by having one of them open it is the perfect width. The table is deeper than office tables, so I can have my monitor further back, have more desk space and leg room (I'm tall too). I'm really happy with the arrangement. I got it for about $30 from ebay. If I'd been luckier, I'd have been able to get one for $10, but wasn't in the right part of the country.  My chair is a refurbished Herman Miller Aeron. I could have got one a bit cheaper straight second-hand, but transport was an issue. That alone took me a touch over your budget, but it's comfortable and supports everything that needs to be supported.   I'm very happy with my choices. I might have gone for a Steelcase Leap chair if one had been in stock, but not sure. I am sure that spending the lions' share on the chair was absolutely the right call and a high-end office chair designed for using for long periods was the way to go. I also like my non-standard desk. When I was looking I also saw some beautiful wooden diningroom tables which were very cheap and would have been lovely if I'd had transport and didn't already have another tempered glass piece of furniture. As it is, I've got a very modern look which suits my needs for relatively little money.	human

3652	If this is a big problem for you across your relationships, it is one of the few situations where I'd recommend therapy or counselling. Generally I think most issues can be sorted out by having a good chat with a close friend, like buddies going to the gym. However in this case you don't have anyone with whom to go to the gym, so you need to hire a personal trainer. A therapist or counsellor will be on your side, give you advice and challenges to help you improve in these areas.  Just remember to ditch them once you're better at making healthy friendships, it'll be temping to keep them as a crutch.  Perhaps follow other advice here first, see if you can get there on your own before paying out what can be a lot of money.  If you have differing interests to people, you're halfway there. You've already approached someone and engaged them in conversation and at least talked about your interests. Good work! Make sure you give them plenty of space to talk about their interests. If you know nothing about them, ask and find out, people love talking about their passions. If you find their interests dull, play a game with yourself and see how long you can get them talking about them or see what else they like. Lots of options.	human

The ones which climbed on top of the pile of bodies a long time ago started to claim that ""is"" is ""ought"". Suddenly their ruling was God-given and it was all about blood and purity. Poor people were meant to be poor - a harsher version of the dark side of the American Dream (i.e. your place in the world was to be poor, it wasn't just that you didn't work hard enough).   Due to purity of blood being an issue, it has meant that the royal families of Europe were pretty inbred. You can only marry cousins for so long before genetics catches up with you. We even had to import royals at at least one point because we ran out.  Today they fulfil a number of roles which benefit the country.

You don't go through school with prominent marks on your face without picking up some serious emotional scars too.

The best part was it was not in my school, but about 20 mins away and you could sneak off for a bit and explore dark corridors. There was a girl there who had pretty bad eczema. She was really sweet and fun, but must have been bullied a lot because she had patches on her face. We were friendly, running around the corridors and occasionally playing a game of chess.   My dad took me to a competition one weekend and all was cool. I'd just finished my game and was walking back to where my family and friends from my school were camped out. When I got there my dad was angry at me. He said ""That girl just skipped up to you, happy to see you and you blanked her. Now she's gone off, probably in tears. I saw what you did and so did her father.""  I felt terrible. I hadn't seen or heard her. I don't recall seeing her again after that.

3691	Being a photographer will help you. You'll already know about lighting and composition. Controlling them is a little tricky but that is because the tool offers so much flexibility, so you'll eventually have more control than you have over your current lighting setup.  What will also help you is you'll be able to create assets to use in your 3D scenes such as textures and environment lighting. With a fisheye lens and a panorama attachment for your tripod, you can take pics to stitch together and use that to light your scene for more natural renders. 	human
3692	In that case I wouldn't put it past Gromit to tweak the design to make it take out everyone while Wallace continues on in blissful ignorance that his partner is loyal and protective beyond all sane limits.	human

With the luxury of cheese, over the course of weeks Wallace built a spaceship. Now that he's entering the first stages of withdrawal he'll build another one in record time, he knows how it's done.  Everyone else would create small arms to kill one another since anything bigger is likely to kill them too. Not a problem for Wallace and Gromit since their ""weapon"" is also their means of escape, incinerating everyone else as they lift off. They don't intentionally kill anyone, that would be out of character, it just happens as a double-effect of Wallace needing cheese above all other considerations.   Any survivors would fight it out between themselves with Rick winning because he's Rick.   edit: tl;dr Wallace and Gromit accidentally kill everyone else in the pursuit to satisfy Wallace's craving because he is cheese-lusted."	human

You shouldn't expect the same outcomes as the character gets, or at least you should give them a careful reality check, but seeing how real people respond to the character can provide reasonably accurate information - provided you also understand that things like the score and simply making someone a protagonist will make engender sympathy. 	human
3704	"I agree. I always use a judo analogy. Judo is about using your opponent's weight and momentum against them, creating a fulcrum and executing a throw. To use their momentum, you have to be going in the same direction as them. A straight ""No"" is a block and you'll get into a pointless yes vs no argument. What you need to do is move with the direction of his argument to deflect it, or create a fulcrum of a counter-example or rebuttal to throw it.  That would be ""Yeah, you're right it was pretty bad. I do like the girls who hang out there though!""  or  ""They do have some rough stuff there. Remember that beer x! God that was awful! Still, not as bad as bar b. You didn't have their beer y though did you? That wasn't too bad and I'd like to give beer z a shot out of morbid curiosity!"" "	human
3705	It will make being accepted by most groups easier since you'd come across as charming and non-threatening, but people don't admire or follow someone who is socially awkward (except on a rare occasion where they break out of their personality and are less awkward for a moment due to anger or something).

3707	The typical Hugh Grant character pulls it off, but his characters tend to have other things going for him like being rich / successful which are inherently attractive, so he gets seen as awkward and lovably charming and eccentric rather than just awkward. His accent and the fact that he looks like Hugh Grant are also significant factors.  Psychological studies have shown that making small mistakes is attractive. The same guy in a video was rated more attractive when he knocked over a glass of water compared to when he didn't.  Playing with kids or animals often comes across as attractive / charming as it shows empathy, making yourself emotionally available and a bit vulnerable. Also young kids have an uncanny ability to take a dislike to people who are false. 	human
3708	The Morgaine Cycle. It's a series of books by C. J. Cherryh. It's basically anti-Stargate.   Morgaine travels from world to world shutting down their gates to protect the worlds they're on because they're so dangerous. Obviously this makes it episodic, like Star Gate or Quantum Leap and would work well on a TV format.   It would be interesting to see it kept from the secondary character's perspective. You never quite get into the mind of Morgaine which makes her all the more interesting.  There's swords, high technology and a pile of tragedy to work with.	human

3712	I'm ambivalent about that. From an individual perspective, yes (and in fact best for them to only teach them MS Office). Practically, people are only going to use one, no one has time to show kids how the operations map across office packages, the teacher probably doesn't know and it would be a hell of a boring lesson.   From a societal perspective, they should use anything other than Microsoft. Early exposure to different platforms and software will help prevent the fear of the different.   People should hate using Microsoft Office. They should be demanding the more powerful formatting options of Libre, the better collaboration possibilities of Google and the slicker presentations of Keynote. Getting kids using different applications is a start to loosening the death-grip MS has on the market and bringing some competition and innovation onto the scene.	human
3713	That's an argument against Libre *and* Google.   I think for their use case Google is the obvious choice and it teaches the students flexibility. It is wrong to be teaching kids that MS Office is the only package to use for producing documents. 	human

3718	Someone posted something saying that MC can dodge some bullets, so walls of undead to impede movement might work to score a hit - if the spears are sufficiently powerful to get through - the way it flew, I'd say it has a decent chance.   In this scenario MC doesn't have any ranged weapons to speak of, so the dragon can light him up at its leisure risk-free from the air. So if dragonfire is effective against his armour, he's history.   If his armour can defend against those and can operate in intense cold for extended periods of time, MC is going to win by attrition.   The undead themselves, I don't think are any direct threat. I'm not sure they could scratch his armour. Maybe the giants could knock him about.	human

3723	Target for what though? Either they can't get through the armour and he has the leisure to kill them one at a time or they do have something that can penetrate and they don't need the thousands of soldiers. 	human
3724	I don't know a huge amount about MC, but I think his powered armour would allow him to break any grip put on him and crush any bone. If it's just the zombies, I don't think they have anything that could penetrate the armour, so it's just a matter of time until he wins.  However, I think the dragon ends MC. Dragonfire is mental and the icefire looks like it might be even nastier than normal dragonfire.   Other dangers are the ice javelin (I don't think that can be trusted to shatter), if the ice king can make it cold enough to cause the suit to malfunction or be susceptible to damage by a giant hitting it with something heavy, and of course the sword.   tl;dr The dragon probably means White Walkers stomp, the zombie army is pretty redundant, only the feats of the WWs and Night King can stop MC otherwise.	human
3725	I've danced with pensioners and fat sweaty women so large I couldn't get my arm positioned on their backs.   I promised myself when I started that I'd treat the woman I'm dancing with as the only one in the room and the one I wanted to dance with. It's not always been easy, but I think I've done ok and am a marginally better person for it. I set out to get a laugh out of everyone I dance with. Usually succeed.   Usually there are some fun, attractive girls there who just want to be spun around and have a good time. I can't knock it. 	human
3726	Wendy sounds like an absolute horror. The way she's sensationalising it has a chance of ruining his business when people dimly recall that the coffee shop had something to do with banning the disabled or a religion and not children.

People tend to train their dogs and have a legal requirement to have them under control, the same is not the case for kids.	human

3728	Also check out dancing, not dissimilar to martial arts in many ways, but you get to lightly grapple with women (and occasionally men on rare times that the numbers don't work in your favour).

3740	"I think there is a line to be drawn, but if not, I'd settle for debates for all.  We have a real problem today with the likes of Milo. Now that access to mass media is a game that anyone can play, the standard of people who are able to participate has dropped like a stone. We have a handful of others like him in the UK who do the rounds of talk shows and regularly tweet controversial messages on current affairs (not just politics) to get the next gig as a talking head. I sincerely don't believe that they believe what they are saying (at least not as strongly as they put their cases), but through chance they get catapulted into the public eye on one occasion and they find that being controversial and building up a highly opinionated persona of themselves for media consumption becomes their meal ticket.   These people are dangerous. When their sight doesn't go beyond the next round of chat shows, of how to increase their popularity, they don't consider the damage their personas are doing by giving some legitimacy and a rallying cry to people who are that extreme. It isn't about ideology or changing society to these people, it's about staying in the limelight and getting that next paycheck.  I'm not saying that he doesn't have some good points. He is correct that more extreme members of minorities use protections society gives them as a sword rather than a shield. ""You can't say that because it offends me"" isn't a legitimate reason for censorship. There seems to be a rush to take the position of the victim because being perceived as weak gives you enormous power. But there's so much else which he needs to be challenged on. With his academic record, I don't think he could stand up to that scrutiny.   Extreme feminists deserve the same scrutiny. It's another subject where a legitimate cause has been hijacked by the loudest and most vitriolic nut-jobs who need to be closely questioned, not just given an opportunity to rant and run. Feminism has a noble purpose and it's a shame that we still need it. However, the third wave seems to have become about ""my rights"" not ""our rights"" and...well it's a whole different subject.   Universities are no longer places for just the best and brightest and haven't been for a long time. Like you said, for many it's just a place to hone writing skills. I'm not saying that people take lectures as gospel, but environmental factors play a significant role in how we process information.  You're right, I don't have anything other than observation to back up that people on the right are further right than how far to the left lefties are (or alternatively, that there is a significant double-bump). I'll keep an eye out for data. A problem I see with US politics isn't just the two party system which makes for uncomfortable bedfellows, but when thinking about voting for the lesser of two evils many so many conservatives see the Democrats as evil, so will only ever vote one way. I know the same is true on both sides, but the liberals I've seen interviewed infrequently have the same delight in hating the other side and I don't think that's just own prejudices colouring my view. "	human
3741	What I was trying to show with the example was that it seems to me that even though the scale might run from Neo Nazi to Communist revolutionary, if you take the 90th percentile of each group, your going to have one person who is much closer to being a Neo Nazi than the other person is to Communist revolutionary. You can't just look at the extremes and say that they're both equally terrible, but look at the distribution of views on the continuum. As far as I know, the Dems don't have an organisation similar to the Tea Party who have been such a powerful polarising influence, pushing the party from the centre ground.  I think we might have to respectfully disagree with one another around free speech. I believe that Antifa and the KKK (or even Communist revolutionaries) should be allowed to say what they want, but that doesn't equate to an organised event in a university building with no opposition. It is too easy to infer a tacit legitimacy from the university. Arguments need to be tested, not just made when they are as bold and controversial as these. Without debate it is all too easy for a good speaker to be persuasive while having very little substance to their position.   You're giving a bit too much credit to students. There are plenty who are up for that kind of critical thinking, but far more who are not. Worse, if the format is effectively a speech / lecture, they have been massively primed to accept what is being said due to environmental cues. Far better to have a debate, educate them how you dismantle a position and allow them to participate with questions. 	human

3744	Your issue should be constrained to objections to the left getting a free pass rather than wanting two wrongs to make a right.   Being from the UK, I don't have an axe to grind on the issue. From what I've seen over the last few years, the right seems to have a lot of people further to the right than the left has to the left. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd characterise your fervently left person as someone who wanted strict gun control or even taking away guns, whereas someone in the same percentile of the right would be advocating shooting a group. On the one hand you have someone making a political point which depending on your position is a great idea to reduce violence or a terrible idea which risks national security and personal defence against other persons and the state. Equally, the other argument is would be interpreted as a rallying call to persecute politically and physically an out-group or a legitimate and vigorous defence of the status quo because what is (or even the perception of what used to be) is what ought to be.  Only one of those positions puts people in danger and reinforces prejudices against a weaker out-group. They don't deserve to be treated the same just because they come from different ends of the spectrum.	human

3746	After my first paper for him, my lecturer took me aside after a tutorial and apologised from not giving me a grade in the range of 70-100. He said that the essay deserved it, but he didn't want to start me off with a perfect score which would be impossible to maintain.   Would that have meant a double-beating?	human
3747	75 is a cliff. You have to do very well to get 75 and every percentage point beyond that needs to come from pure genius written in arterial blood.	human
3748	I think you're conflating a few things here.  The whole safe space nonsense seems to be student-led, rather than coming from the career academics. It is frightening because uni should be a safe space for ideas, not people's beliefs - even if challenging those beliefs in a lively debate hurts their feelings.  They way it was carried out was wrong, but if the setup of the Milo event is as I believe, it should not have gone ahead. A university debate with experts is the perfect way to expose his espoused ideologies as wrong and his subject matter knowledge profoundly wanting. What you can't do is let him spew hate and leave largely unchallenged. That kind of propaganda needs to be taken apart point by point and discredited along with the speaker.   There are some rules which generally work well, but cannot be applied to themselves. Tolerance is one of them. You should be tolerant of other ideas, but not of intolerance.  I don't believe in no platforming, I firmly believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant, but positions such as Milo Y's do not merit one which is not fiercely contested, the ideas are too controversial to deserve a podium to themselves. Just imagine how glorious it would have been to have a video of him being utterly eviscerated by a tweed-bedecked lecturer who had studied the arguments for years and was used to pulling the rug from under students who trotted out old fallacies to justify their prejudices.   Back to your points, I appreciate academics' position too. It must be irritating to have students who have been studying your particular area of expertise for a month to think that they can casually undermine your considered, published opinion of decades. This is more of a threat to lesser minds in their field like the two who I discussed, because they will inwardly know that they are not the best in their field. I always take note when someone wants to shut down debate, it usually means that their position is weak, or they are incapable of defending it. I think Anita Sarkeesian is a great example of this.   I've only ever seen Sarkeesian participate in soft interviews or speak to a sympathetic audience. It isn't because her general position is weak, there is a lot of sexism in computer games. However, she isn't the sharpest tool in the shed and her characterisation of it is flawed, misleading and often simply false. When you have to resort to underhand tactics to make a strong case for a position which is so clearly correct, you are the wrong person to be making that case. Haha, I've rambled my way back to Milo Y, who is like this, but without the luxury of starting with a strong case!	human

3752	I had another lecturer who when I questioned her reasoning told me that I either believed what she was saying now, or I never would, so there was no point in discussion!  She was married to a Professor in the department who was the leading light in his field, so I think they had her give a few minor lectures to keep her on the payroll and try to keep him. It's a different world!	human
3753	I had one who told us on the first day that he was teaching what he believed was correct, we were welcome to counter that in our essays, but we wouldn't score as highly because in his eyes we'd be on the wrong side of the argument. Props for fair warning, but not quite the open-mindedness I'd expected of an academic at a good uni.	human
3754	They're serious. For humanities 75 is effectively the limit. You'd have to invent an irrefutable new paradigm in your subject or something to get more. It might be different for maths and the sciences where there are correct answers, but for essays, you're never going to see more than 75.	human

3760	Probably the right balance. Even if you do meet people who you rubbed the wrong way, at least they'll remember you which is usually better than being forgettable. Also, people like people more who they initially didn't like, so it can work in your favour both in the short and medium terms.	human
3761	He's an ok guy, always likes the verbal sparring of debates, but would take it too far after a few drinks. However, taking it too far seemed to be an effective strategy for him to find girls who were interested while leaving behind a much larger trail of ones who decided he was a jerk. He didn't seem to mind that at all. Some would say that's the right attitude, but it's too abrasive for me	human
3762	I had a housemate who'd do this. He'd take it a bit too far and be outright obnoxious after a few drinks (and as I found out later, cocaine!) He'd play devil's advocate and be very confrontational. It scared off most girls, but the ones who were prepared to play along, he was quickly teasing and things progressed from there.  I don't know if it was a conscious strategy (I saw him do it to the gf of his boss who was clearly uncomfortable, bordering of disgusted by some of the positions he took, not a good career move), but he seemed completely unfazed by the rejections and just moved on.  In his favour was a childish exuberance, an ok sense of humour, a tall, gangly physique and total irreverence. Not unattractive, but not going to win any prizes.	human
3763	That would still be awkward since you'd be looking above the line and then below the line and trying to mentally put the lines next to one another. Better to map them next to one another, so a side by side bar chart would work, but a dotplot would be preferable. You could write the total number of texts after the last dot so you could still compare totals.	human
3764	That's a healthy lot of communication going on there! Congratulations on your first R project.  What I'd find more interesting, instead of total communications, a comparison between who is texting whom the most.

There is a nice example half way down the page, You'll only need to tweak your ggplot command a little to get it.

3766	"Apple's modern popularity starts with the iMac which saved the company. Jobs pretty much bet the farm on Jony ive's design, but it was far from the first all in one PC. It was however the sexiest. A good gamble, but not innovation. When people talk about Apple and innovation, they tend to be talking about it from this time onwards, not the comparatively modest success of a company that was going since the 1970s. This ""second but sexier"" is the strategy which they've successfully pursued ever since.  The iPod was the next big win. Not the first to the market. The iStore was also not the first. Another company...Diamond? had to fight the music industry tooth and nail to be able to operate an online store. Once the legal fight had been won, Apple came in with iTunes. They did do a better job at linking it to their device, but again, they let others take the risk, prove the concept, then do some snagging to provide a good user experience.   The Macintosh GUI. Excellent innovation, some argue was then blatantly stolen by Microsoft. However, it's not an example the business people I've heard worship Apple are thinking of. It should be, but isn't.   iPhone interface. What aspect are you talking about? There were things like Palm Pilots about for some time before, even the dismal Apple Newton which was effectively a premature iPhone. The use of a capacitative touch screen was not first done by Apple. IBM created the first phone with a touch screen in the 90s which was dubbed a ""smartphone"". Apple acquired the firm which created multi-touch screens, it wasn't their innovation.   Apple are not an innovative company, or at least not to the extent for which they're given credit. They are amazing at marketing and for creating a fantastic user experience which leaves the first to market crowd eating their dust.  Apple have done such a great job at selling the fact that they are innovative and creative that people who are given a creative task are more imaginative when they see the Apple logo than when they don't.  I don't have anything against Apple (ok, their prices, obviously, but no philosophical problem), but I do have some issues with the Cult of Apple, be that their users who claim they ""don't know how to use a PC"" or the people I talk to more frequently who want their organisation to ""be more like Apple"". Usually they don't know what that means beyond people looking impressed when you name drop and associations with being cool and innovative. "	human
3767	Haha. Cutting.  To be fair to her though, I've never heard her go on the attack like that. Instead she seems to spend her life being the victim, if anyone doesn't like her or disagrees with her then it's because they are sexist, racist or both, not because they have a valid point. She goes straight for the ad hominem.	human
3768	I always chuckle inwardly and downgrade my opinion of someone when they say that they want to be innovative like Apple. I've never heard someone use it in the context of being second or third to the market.	human

3770	"The only way I see Trump wanting to stay on in the White House is if he thinks his next step is going to be another government building with rather more bars.   I don't think Trump likes being President. It's far more work than he's used to (even doing the POTUS-Lite version he does now), lots of people are being unkind about him and he can't ignore them or shut them down in they way he's used to.   Trump isn't about power, he's about popularity and money. He's going to want to get back to his business and cash in the favours he's done while in office to further enrich himself.  As the article says, ""Trump is only interested in Trump. He’s willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of self-preservation."" He'd only try to keep power if he felt at risk of jail and I think the establishment, however much they dislike him, want to set the precedent of locking up the President. "	human
3771	Come on, BoatyMcBoatFace was a classic brand of British humour. Ok, it wasn't the high-brow dry wit variety to which I think we should generally aspire, but it has a Monty Python anarchic irreverence to it. You'll struggle to find another country with such a complex, multifaceted relationship with humour as us.   It is true that if we had a referendum, we would likely bring back the death penalty. It is sad, but hardly unique that our lowest common denominator have some very low opinions.   I agree, you need to get out of this cultural shithole and experience some other cultural shitholes. Travel on a few continents, not just capital cities, but smaller ones too. You'll find that no one is doing it right, but we're doing it better than most.	human
3772	I found that I was hamstrung by my English when learning French and German at GCSE. Teaching English grammar had gone out the window, so our knowledge ended at being able to sort nouns from verbs. The French lessons assumed we'd know all of the parts of speech and tenses. Perhaps that had been true for previous years, but not mine. Between learning those rules and the language, it was a struggle for any who didn't have a talent.   I think we've got language teaching all wrong. We treat reading, writing and speaking as equally important. We should massively focus on speaking. That's the gateway for learning our first language and it's where most of the benefit is for the second and third. Let the other areas catch up naturally once you can make yourself understood. 	human
3773	We aren't terrible people and the country hasn't gone to the dogs since Brexit. It's a weird national quirk of ours that we seem to enjoy reading how terrible we are.   That said, Europe has many attractions. It's a shame that so many are only starting to get publicised now that we're leaving. As for moving permanently, the cost of living and quality of life seem to be far superior in other countries.   It's funny that we're actually going to benefit from the dismal language education on offer by our schools. Far more people would  risk a new life in Europe if language wasn't such a barrier.	human
3774	Cut that time in half, at least. Have some face to face interactions with people in a format where you feel comfortable and do some social activities which push you out of your comfort zone a bit. We are social creatures, INTJs prefer 1-1 interactions or very small groups, but we are not cut out to for complete social isolation. You get good things going on in your brain chemistry when you interact with people face to face in real life, lots of cues which you don't otherwise get trigger reactions. 	human

3789	A lot of people eat rabbits and don't really have compassion for them like they do other animals which is unfortunate.  Rabbits have a huge  range of emotions including jealousy, anger, fear, grief, love, irritability and loneliness.  A domesticated rabbit's life is an unnatural one... stuck in a hutch hutch on display for a passing predator.  Doing nothing but suffering and waiting for nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
3790	As an electrical engineering student, I refuse to work for a government organization (even though the work they do is unique) mostly because they are SO slow to move.  It's the private sector, not the government, that are light years ahead of the tech curve. We have a lot of commercial entities bringing big cash that NASA doesn't have. 20 years ago NASA was absolutely at the forefront as far as the development of robotic technology but that was back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

3800	I expected the undertaker.	human
3801	This is an awesome picture. My grandfather had a fridge in his house that he would mark the heights and dates of my sister and I on. Eventually (in Highschool) I was taller than the fridge and we could no longer mark it. He sentimentally kept that fridge even after it stopped working because of those marks. After he passed away my father and I went to his house to clean it out... it was hard to throw away that fridge. 	human
3802	And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.	human
3803	i would never post such a thing - but appreciated the effort of the guy who did it. 	human
3804	This might be cute now but wait until that thing weighs 350 pounds and has tusks as sharp as knives sticking out of it's mouth.  I grew up on a farm and we raised a lot pigs - all piglets start off really cute and adorable but just a few months down the line they can become rather large and unpredictable.  It's very important that you train them when they are small or you will have a very heavy, smart, strong, and dangerous animal to deal with.  I imagine by the time this one if full grown he will probably weigh close to nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
3805	Can confirm Deadmau5 is kind of a jerk.  He bought a house in Ontario not far from where my cousin lives and besides driving like an idiot all over town he is known at local restaurants to be a terrible tipper .  My cousin works at a steakhouse and he came in with a huge group of people on a very busy night without reservations - they proceeded to make a mess of the place and when it came time to tip they only left nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
3806	I saw Chris Tucker recently perform at a casino in Nevada.  He seems to have aged a lot over the last few years.  He was fairly intoxicated when he came onstage and proceeded to drink a good amount more over the course of the evening.  Eventually he called a woman from the front row onstage and asked the sound guy to put on a song from nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
3807	Also wears glasses, has browns eyes with a mustache.	human
3808	I really do drive a Subaru outback turbo.	human
3809	I live in San Jose (close to the factory) and have seen some of these Tesla semis driving around town... this video almost doesn't do them justice. I drive a Subaru with a turbo and pulled up next to one at a stop light. I was checking it out and decided I would try to keep pace with it when the light turned green - when you consider a car w/ a turbo vs a semi it really shouldn't even be as close as it was... I stomped on the gas and checked my side mirror and the semi was right there almost gaining on me. I didn't start pulling away from it until I hit nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
3810	Did anyone think it was a Nike swoosh just by looking at the thumbnail?  I didn't. 	human
3811	I trained at Team Alpha Male when I lived in Sacramento and unfortunately most of the stories about TJ are true. I personally never sparred with him but was there to observe some of his sparring and it is pretty clear he is driven by an uncontrollable anger.  As you can see in the video Takeru wasn't even being aggressive with him (actually smiling) but TJs aggression issue is a part of his personality.  The worst I probably ever saw him get out of hand was back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

3816	Getting small bags of pasta when you travel through Italy is actually incredibly common.  It is a form of advertising and walking down most main streets you will see people handing these out.  It is never enough noodles to actually make it worth cooking but is somewhat akin to a business card/advertisement from nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table. 	human

3825	"Damn dude, I appreciate that...  I never wanted to put out merch... a part of that is shame I feel - Im sure I could not sure I would want to make money from reddit.  Back in the day I posted a lot on reddit with clickbait titles trying to run up some adsense money.  I was homeless/living a concrete floor warehouse during those times and justified it.  I have created ""Morph"" beanies - which I have the pattern for but never put out... - I am not trying to piss off the WWE - and mostly not trying to piss of Reddit.  The one thing I never put out reddit wise which I could have made a good amount of money on is ""RedditCoin"" - I paid a team of programmers to develop it back in the day (2013 - 2014) - and my friends and I mined it by a few thousand to verify its function.  That would be the way for me to make a few extra bucks but imagine reddit would kill my account if I promoted that.  This shittymorph account is worth the world to me as stupid as that sounds.  I will check in with the reddit admin I know and seek permission to release a morph hat - I dont think it would fly but it doesn't hurt to ask... - Thanks for getting me thinking about that.  - If we get to creating such a thing I will send you something for free.

3833	The Undertaker legit scared me as a kid - I grew up in a time when I could buy [these](http://www.wrestlecrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/WWF-Superstars-Cereal.jpg) - I was a wrestling fan - When the Undertaker came around he scared the shit out of little kids like me... and Paul Bearer (rest in peace) was a fantastic character.  I loved the Undertaker... I saw a reference to the match on Facebook out of context... and realized it was hilarious to reference an old school (but unique) wrestling match - the post I was browsing was about dogs... and here comes the wrestling reference out of no where - the fact it was funny out of context made me try something similar on reddit and here we are... the creating a backstory was another layer I added to provide a bit of a buffer before the punch.	human
3834	Hey man, My strategy has changed since I started... at first when no one knew who I was and most people downvoted me and told me to stfu I just spammed without a care... I posted it everywhere - no effort - no pre-story... eventually people started to recognize me... I decided to start hiding the punch line... I used to include numbers which I started to write out in letters... now people skip to the end of paragraphs even when it's not me... so I have been trying to wait between posts... I will go a week or two without posting... I posted last night... it got 5.8k ups with gold but I wasn't feeling it when I woke up this morning... so I deleted it... I let time wedge itself between me and the people reading my posts - and then I come to get them.  Waiting for the right time... drifting behind a top comment... those a couple strategies. 	human
3835	Thank you TheSirPez, I appreciate people like you who take the time to let me know.  I put a good amount of time and effort into typing up the nonsense I do... to hear it is appreciated validates my efforts.  Thank you good SirPez	human

3838	I personally liked [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/5wnnur/til_a_man_in_shaanxi_china_recently_realized_that/deblju1/) - Partially because it was inspired by my grandmother who had lived in Northern Italy during World War 2 - the nazis shot her cow and raided her house for food... After that she kept a gun around with her - even into the 90s when I was a young kid... when I would want to go rent a game or movie from Blockbuster she would insist on coming with me and of course would pack her gun.  As she started to have memory issues people go worried about her with her gun but she wouldn't give it up.  Eventually my Dad got ahold of it when she was sleeping and removed a part so that it wouldn't fire.  Anyway... thats the story behind that post and why I enjoy it.  	human

3844	I understand... and me posting this was especially dark - as my father killed himself recently - and alcohol was a huge contributing factor.  So even though I am making a joke... it is also just me talking about something that hurts me... and finding a laugh to go with the pain... my inappropriate way of talking about things. 	human

3846	I removed my original posting a while back - but a few other people have reuploaded it - I noticed someone had uploaded recently... I hadn't listened to it since my Dad killed himself... felt it was worth a share.  If you ever have someone talk to you like this just know they are really talkng to themselves. 	human
3847	I'm probably going to get downvoted for this but as the child of an alcoholic having alcohol the focus of a beautiful moment just doesn't make sense to me.  My Dad used to ask me to go get him beers from the fridge and I would... when I was around 8 or 9 I opened a beer and drank it before I got it to him.

3859	I'm ok... I foolishly quit my job recently because I felt I was rich from bitcoin... I had been putting most of my money into it --  It crashed by 70+% and was a real kick in the dick,.  Thankfully we have recovered a bit  --  I was an idiot for quitting my job when I did. 	human

3861	Growing up - My father would take me to the video store and let me pick movies to rent... vhs days... - I would pick the wrestlemania videos and such - Undertaker was a noob when I started to watch but have loved his work ever since.  Hope to meet him and shake his hand at some point in this lifetime.  Not sure if Mick ignored me intentionally or not but he had no response to my comment when I showed up to his AMA - I won't hold it against him - but between the 2 I am an undertaker fan. 	human
3862	I haven't watched really - I have seen some luge and some ski jumping - I think the luge people are the craziest so I will have to go with them as far as watching preference. 	human

3878	I was an ultralight backpacker for a while but now I am going car camping - I have an 8 man tent for Scooby and I with plent of solar stuff - 3 different cooking devices - etc - I don't do well in a box - and I get discouraged as far as working for more than a couple years in the same place.  To me life is not life lived when you work your life away - I want to find a balance while fulfilling my obligations.  So I work... then camp or live in the woods - and go back to work.  I'm an IT guy and find jobs ok - but my life is built trying to find a balance between work and the outdoors.	human
3879	I wouldn't call myself a cult figure - reddit hated me a long time ago but they just don't know it... As is mentioned in the post by cnet I had spammed reddit for youtube/adsense views back in the day - a lot of people caught on and hated me for it - I adjusted my efforts here and somehow ended up an endearing personality instead.  I was homeless/living in a warehouse when I was spamming for adsense money - trying to get a few hundred extra per month to live... - I am not proud of that but thats what it was - Thanks for the comment about Scooby - he's a very special addition to my situation - I am not a rich person I barely get by a lot of the time - Scooby requires some financial/personal sacrifice but is worth it - I wish I was rich our lives would be easier but then again I'm not so sure I would appreciate a rich mans perspective - As far as giving out gold I got a little lucky with bitcoin and felt rich until it crashed and made me humble.  - Anyway - I didn't much think these answers over before I typed them so please excuse if they are a bit wild. 	human

When I was first starting out I heard a commercial on the radio - asking for people that were into acting and modeling.  I responded... I was stoked when the guy running the place said I had a bright future in the business... I waited everyday for weeks for the phone call - and it finally came... only instead of a bright future I got hit with a good scam... they wanted money for me to take headshots for their agency - and money for classes... I was bummed.  I eventually ended up with a REAL agent (and was only less bummed) but that fake modeling/acting stuff was a real kick in the heart.	human

I initially brought it to reddit as a 1 liner... it sort of ""morphed"" into a paragraph of on-point info before the punchline - I'm not sure the exact point that it started to become that but I went from a 1 liner to thinking up a short paragraph with a drop off at the end...

3900	He is afraid of every dog he meets... When I brought him back to the shelter to reunite with the people who originally rescued him they brought the smallest chihuahua in the shelter out to meet Scooby.  Scooby cowered down to the chihuahua and started to drool which is something he does when he is nervous.  It was sad to watch... :(	human
3901	I have a special place in my heart for bulldogs - They are so impulsive and ridiculous... I really identify with them.  Scooby is coming around - He sleeps next to me every night... he didn't have any training when I met him... but since then he is now house trained, sits, stays, shakes with both paws, lays down... and knows a few words.  He will be an ongoing project but we go well together so far.  	human

3907	I picked Scooby up from the shelter a year ago today... I originally only intended to foster him but somewhere along the way I decided to keep him. Sadly I think a lot of the damage done to him by the dogfighters might never be fixed... I do my best to give him good experiences to replace those bad memories... and I still love him regardless of how timid and scared he is. He doesn't have to be anything more than he already is... and he is a welcome addition to my family. Happy 1 year out of the shelter buddy. 	human
3908	My girlfriend works for a major bank and if any bills come in with ink pack dye on them she is supposed to act normal but notify a manager immediately.  The person trying to deposit or change in the bill will usually be questioned by authorities about where and when they acquired the bill.  Most bank robbery bills that are recovered have usually changed hands a few times by the time they are identified which makes them fairly difficult to trace.  Dye packs have been around for a long time but banks also started using micro GPS units back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

3912	Another tip as far as microwaves is if you have a Samsung model there's a good chance that you might be able to play tetris on it.  While holding down the start button if you press 1, 2, 3, 4 in sequence and then release the start button it will activate a hidden tetris easter egg.  You use the 2, 4, 6, and 8 buttons to move the blocks and the start button will rotate them.  Just a heads up though: this only works on Samsung microwaves that were made after nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table. 	human

3924	I had to chance to see them live back in the 90s at the height of their popularity and they put on an AMAZING show.  I anticipated that their live show wouldn't be able to reproduce what they recorded in a studio but their harmonies were perfect and they nailed every single song they performed.  Their flow was unmatched back in the day and I'd say it is still rare to find a rapper capable of doing what these guys did back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

3930	A bait dog is used by dog fighters - sometimes their mouth will be secured closed so they cannot fight back or protect themselves... Fighting dogs in training will pick them apart.  Scooby has a lot of scars that indicate he was a bait dog.  If life is yin and yang he's getting the good part now. 	human

I can't raise my voice around him... the other 4 dogs he was brought in with were put down to aggressive tendecies.  His disposition was different... he wanted to trust.  He sleeps in my bed every night without issue.  I tell him I love him and kiss him multiple times every day.  I'm not sure it would go so well if he was an actual fighting dog - but since he was most likely a bait dog I don't have to worry about him being aggressive.  I have to worry about him being afraid of things he shouldn't be afraid of... he's worth every bit of extra effort he requires.  Absolutely love him. "	human

He was a foreman on commercial jobs and said no human could possibly do this with that kind of precision and speed.

3943	My grandfather worked for Budweiser when I was growing up but he NEVER drank any of their beer.  He liked to tell a story about how when he first started his job was to walk around the tanks of beer with a net on a pole and a bucket.  He would scoop dead rats out of the beer by the dozens - they would get drunk, fall in, and drown in the beer by the bucketful.  Him telling me that story cost budweiser a few bucks when I was finally old enough to drink in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
3944	"This happened to my grandmother - She is hard of hearing as it is and the scammer asked her several times ""Can you hear me?"" and she just kept saying yes.  They hung up on her and sure enough she was fraudulently charged for a time-share that she wanted nothing to do with.  Our family hired a lawyer to help her out and when the court date came they produced edited audo of her responding to their questions  saying ""yes.""  Eventually the charges went away after the company was accused by multiple people of fraud.  It's a VERY common scam unfortunately that has been primarily preying on elderly people since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human
3945	I showed my Dad this clip because he works as a welder and he said this is absolutely an automated machine in action.  He has 30+ years experience and said a human doing this job just wouldn't be capable of the consistency.  He said even the most talented welders in the world would leave visible hairline differences and minor gaps.  He then went into a rant about how automation has effectively been taking our jobs since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

3948	My Uncle is a pilot for a major airline and he showed me a picture of a plane that ran through some geese shortly after takeoff.  The damage they did the plane looked similar to this but not as bad - apparently geese just explode into a ball of feathers when you hit them at a high rate of speed but still leave massive dents. There wasn't any blood on the plane because by the time the splatter happens the plane is already beyond the point of impact.  It doesn't happen very often but a good number of smaller planes have been brought down in collisions with birds since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
3949	It is a thing but unfortunately can be a dangerous one.  Puppies need to be taught to interact safely with the new family member which can take some time.  A good number of infants are injured accidentally by puppies - often when mom or dad attempts to get a cute picture or video.  Puppies are easily startled and the crying of an infant or unexpected touch can easily lead to nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
3950	"When I was growing up my mom would get really upset at my Dad for watching Married with Children.  She said it was ""filth"" but what it really boiled down to was she didn't like my Dad watching Christinas character.  I remember a few times when they would get into a fight and my mom would say ""Why don't you go sleep on the couch tonight and watch your Married with Children.""  Most of the time he did just that. It's no wonder they finally got divorced back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human

He responded to this video saying that he actually had a pass to go up on the platform but the security didn't know that and treated him as a common fan.

His temperament wasn't extreme aggression - it was extreme fear.  Scooby will probably never be a ""normal"" dog - I don't think the damage done to him by the dogfighters could ever be fully undone... he requires a lot of extra patience.

They were ordered to clean the tree cover from the highway after a heavy snow storm.  My Uncle was under a large branch when the weight from the snow snapped it back onto him breaking his back.  He went back and forth with his employer about it until nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table. 	human

4032	I was explaining what it was like after my Dad killed himself... Cleaning his house out unable to rid the place of his decomposed body smell.  How he essentially melted into the floor because we didn't find him for a few weeks.  It was a serious comment... I eventually removed it because I like to keep my profile to only hell in the cell comments.	human

4034	Yes Scooby and I are solving mysteries up here for a couple of weeks. 	human
4035	I unfortunately had to deal with this when my Dad killed himself.  He lived in a very rural area and his body was not found for 2 - 3 weeks... it was over 100 degrees in the house.  He essentially decomposed into his bed... and then down into the floor as you mentioned.  The coroner put a seal on the door to his house that I had to pay 4,000 dollars to a biocleaning service to remove.  I expected a lot more for the 4k than what I got... They cut his bed up into little pieces and bagged it up... then they cut the floor out from under his bed and removed it leaving joists and dirt exposed.  I thought they would do something about the smell but they didn't... I spent a month going through his belongings with the smell of his body in the background. NOTHING would remove that smell...  I patched the floor and painted the walls and it didn't help... the smell of his body stuck to my clothes and hair.  I cleaned every day for weeks... I finally gave up on the place when I realized that I would have to remove the sheetrock and possibly even the dirt from underneath where his bed was.  This was just in the last couple of years... I'm glad my father is no longer tormented but the experience of being in that house for a month is something I will never forget.	human
4036	"Unfortunately this picture is NOT of Jim Carrey - to OPs credit there are several ""before they were stars"" websites that incorrectly have this listed as Jim.

4037	I keep a fat stash of Scooby snacks with me at all times. 	human
4038	Just to clarify: yes Scooby was the longest resident at the shelter.  He couldn't be adopted for over a year while the case against the dog fighters he was rescued from went to court.  Once they plead guilty and were sentenced Scooby became eligible for adoption.  He was estimated to be 4 - 5 years old... and was not house trained - this coupled with his history of being rescued from a dog fighting property scared off a lot of people.  He was there just long enough for me to find him.  He is somewhat trained now - He shakes with both paws... lays down... sits... stays and is house trained.  He requires a lot of extra effort but he is absolutely worth it.  	human
4039	OPs dog is lucky to not have severe injuries from this.  My dad had an awesome pitbull when I was growing up that ended up running through a glass door.  The door had recently been cleaned and looked open to him.  He was cut really badly and bleeding a lot so my dad rushed him to the vet right away.  The vet did his best to save the dog but unfortunately in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

4041	"When I was growing up my mom found my bong I kept under the desk in my room.  I was really careful about keeping it tucked away but one afternoon I came from school and there was my bong in the middle of the kitchen table -- with a fresh bouquet of flowers stuck in it.  She had decided to ""clean up"" my room for me, found it, and thought it was a vase.  The thing stayed on our table too until nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human

4043	When I was pregnant I would unfortunately vomit regularly.  I was also told by my dentist that brushing my teeth immediately after throwing up was a bad idea - his logic was that the acid that degrades the enamel is still active in the mouth so his suggestion was that I first rinse my mouth out with water a couple of times and THEN brush. I never did wait the 30 minutes to brush that OP suggests and I didn't get any new cavities... However, it is absolutely agreed upon that brushing without rinsing first can cause more damage than nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4044	This is how you make a grown man cry. 	human
4045	It's a very sad thing - but if Scooby wasn't a bait dog he may have been a fighting dog.  The other 4 fighting dogs he was found with were put to sleep for being too aggressive - the silver lining for Scooby is that his submissive temperament allowed him to be re-homed.  All in all a messed up situation but I'm trying to give Scoob all the love he missed out on in the beginning of his life. 	human

It can get away from you and can be an escape... and I can be wrong for using it but I do.  Still respect on your efforts to take control of your direction.  I have been following bitcoin since back in the day - used to set my laptop up to mine coins before work several years ago... - I eventually formatted my hard drive with all my coins on them -- I still have the hard drive waiting for the technology to unformat drives to become common.  - I did grab a little coin on the cheap and am a hodler.  I personally believe bitcoin going to be worth hundreds of thousands per coin eventually... I could be wrong so don't bet on my bet - but that's my bet.  Check out /r/bitcoin when you get a second and I would stay away from bitcoin cash.  Ethereum as a lot of potential but again don't take my advice for anything... I'm just a guy who never really did much with his life besides keep working and start a meme that sort of caught on.  - Thanks for the kind comments as far as putting a smile on your face...

4191	I drive for Uber and picked up a crazy lady who refused to get out of the car at the airport unless I pulled into a no parking zone.  She didn't want to walk the extra distance to her terminal but I wasn't going to get a ticket on her behalf.  After about 10 minutes of back and forth she finally relented and got out calling me every name in the book on the way.  I contacted Uber about the incident and they tacked on an extra nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

4220	I had the chance to meet the Undertaker when I was a few years older than Billy in this picture.  My Dad brought the entire family to a WWE (WWF back then) event -  He was friends with one of the people that traveled around with the show and set up the ring so he got my Dad a few free tickets.  The Undertaker is a HUGE man but he went out of his way not to scare us kids - he shook hands and signed autographs for my older brother and I.  It's one of my favorite memories from my childhood. 	human

4243	Baseball was a big part of my life growing up - My step-father and I didn't get along unless we were talking baseball.  I tried to learn the stats to impress him... to bond with him more.  My real father was drowning himself in booze and I wanted to relate to a father figure... we never did manage to relate to each other.  I hit a grandslam once in little league and the coach gave me the ball... it was the only game that my real father ever attended.  I still have the ball.  Baseball meant a lot to me at one point.	human
4244	Just like the strike. 	human
4245	No, I haven't.  Lost my love of baseball back during the strikes.  It was my favorite sport as a child.  I court recite the top batting averages in each league - tell you who was leading the league in doubles or triples... or stolen bases.  I was only 8 or 9 at the time but I got the sports section of the paper every morning with my bowl of cereal to go over the stats... then the strike happened and that missing time threw me off course... Haven't followed baseball since.	human

A lot of the time people buying fish come in with children and of course the kids want to carry the new fish - problem is when a kid is in charge a lot of fish are dropped on the floor and never even make it to the register.  The solution to this is for us to make up 2 bags - one with the real fish and one with a fake fish.  This solves the problem of nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

4269	My wife runs an art gallery and low poly art is really popular right now.  One thing about the low poly art style is that it can look incredible (like OPs quilt) or absolutely amateur without much middle ground between the two extremes.

Also feeding wildlife the wrong kind of food can cause disease, mouth injuries, throat obstructions or even death.

4345	I have small art studio in San Francisco and have been painting myself for around 25 years.  Your father's artwork is an absolute masterpiece.  One of the first things that stood out to me was that your dad is truly a master of light and shadows - this lends to the fantastic depth of the piece.  I would be curious to know where your father studied - I haven't seen artwork of this quality since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4346	"I really hope the World Cube Association recognizes this. They are the  governing body of speedsolving/speedcubing and unfortunately would also require footage of the cube being scrambled for this world record to count.  Hopefully someone has that footage. Another potential issue is the cube was a ""Boron Valk M"" which is a cube not available for purchase to the general public.  This was the most unexpected moment in speedcubing since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human
4347	Hope everybody knows this is a photoshop. A lot of people are really giving him a bad time these days but a few of us who listen to his services know he has a good heart.  He ABSOLUTELY should have been the first one to open his doors to the people in their time of need  and he wasn't.  Still I believe he has done more good for this world than bad since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4348	This comment section is full of jokes but an Ostrich can be incredibly dangerous if they are pissed off or scared.  They're not predators but will also not hesitate to chase a human if they feel threatened.  They can run up to 43 mph and WHEN they catch up to you they will kick you in the back to knock you down - a kick from an ostrich can generate around 500psi which is way more than enough to kill a human.  There have been over 120 ostrich related deaths since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4349	Joel Olsteen really gets a bad rap from a lot of people that don't know him very well.  I have attended many of his services and have had the pleasure to meet him both before and after church.  For the most part he is a very decent human being - of course he has his flaws and there are things he says that my wife and I don't agree with but overall in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4350	"For all the shit Guy Fieri gets he's actually a pretty decent person. He runs a charity called ""Cooking With Kids"" that helps less privileged kids learn how to cook. My nephew went to one of his courses through a youth group and had a blast. They learned how to cook a few different dishes most of it was fairly healthy.  Guy has  been running the charity since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human
4351	I went to Yosemite a couple of years ago when California was experiencing a drought and Yosemite Falls was [seriously affected.](http://nsidc.org/sites/nsidc.org/files/icelights/files/2013/03/snow_drought_yosemite.jpg) All the lakes in California had incredibly low water lines but  for some reason I didn't expect the falls to be reduced to a trickle.  It was a depressing experience for me because it was nothing like I remembered it to be from my first trip there...  I had originally visited Yosemite with my family back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4352	I'm sorry to be THAT guy but I've been painting for 30 years and this is NOT in the style of Bob Ross.  Bob Ross was a wonderful painter but he did a lot of his paintings in a hurry.  There is no possible way you can paint what this woman has in any sort of rush. In particular the detail in the water is fantastic - I'd say it's one of the better paintings I've seen on reddit since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4353	Agreed, although sometimes the shitshow comments provide the most entertainment.  Whenever I need a good laugh I go to the Yahoo comment section and read a few comments.  It's a collection of the most repulsive, idiotic, and ridiculous ideas on the internet.  I'm fairly certain there will never be a day when we all agree on politics but we CAN all agree that in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

When executing a ""deck fan"" the amount of pressure being applied is key to the cards spreading out evenly.  We usually see ""thumb fans"" but in this case the pressure is being applied from the bottom of the deck with his left index finger. The cards are then rotated with his middle and ring fingers. It also helps to have a fresh deck of cards from nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human
4355	Paul Pogba is nothing short of amazing and at only 24 years old the sky is the limit for him. There aren't many people on earth who can handle the ball like him - the curve on this shot and placement is proof. He deserves all the recognition and money he gets... His transfer from Juventus to Manchester United was the 2nd most expensive since nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4356	Home owner here: Love owning a home but mowing the lawn is the bane of my existence.  Unfortunately for me the old lady who runs the Home Owners Association in the neighborhood carries around a ruler in her vehicle and is a real bitch.

4357	Came here to mention this - I work at a gas station in California and we check the pumps every other week for inline devices.   These skimmers do NOT emit a Bluetooth signal and require the thief to show back up and retrieve the device.  The seals that are placed on the outside of the pump to indicate if it has been tampered with are pretty easy to get around.  Credit card thieves are a lot more tricky these days than they were back in  nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4358	My grandfather used to be able to do this trick.  It was usually during a family gathering after he had a few shots of whiskey.  It was both exciting and nerve-racking when he pulled out the old bear trap - but mostly for my grandmother who wouldn't even stay in the room when he did it.  My grandfather said he learned the trick from his grandfather back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

4360	EMT here:  This LOOKS like a lot of fun but the way they are doing it is actually incredibly dangerous.  None of them are waiting to see where the last one landed and therefore many are diving almost on top of each other.  This is one of the ways neck and spine injuries can occur.

4361	I worked on the set of Super Troopers 2 (so maybe I'm a bit biased) - I'm fairly  positive it's going to be a well received film.  We had a lot of talent both in front of and behind the cameras. Yes you can expect some references to ST1 but that is the case with most any sequel. From what parts of the script I saw the jokes are not completely rehashed material from nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4362	I live in Poland and doing anything other than stopping and observing during this minute REALLY pisses some people off. Often times it will be a tourist who does not mean to offend - and it is a bit amusing to see them suddenly realize the rest of the city has stopped doing everything. We have been stopping for this minute in Warsaw since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4363	This comic is SO TRUE!! - My best friend's life all plays out in 1 square mile... He has a job and an apartment really close to each other - the only other places he goes are the gas station, the grocery store, and the school he takes his daughter to -- he will literally NEVER leave his safe routine area. I've asked him about it and he says he thinks it's related to a traumatic incident he had back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4364	My grandmother went to the VERY first KFC in North Corbin, KY (it wasn't called KFC yet) and she actually got to meet Colonel Sanders (he went by Harland back then) - He had a roadside stand selling chicken in North Corbin during the Great Depression. She said he always looked like a 60 year old man even back when he was 30 - she attributed this to his poor diet and refused to eat KFC in her old age.  She said he was really busy but nice enough when they met back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4365	I work as a line cook in a restaurant and one of my co-workers is constantly looking for religious images to appear in the food we prepare.  Sometimes it's the burn marks on the toast or a pattern on a dirty pan that might look like a crucifix... Just a few weeks ago he asked if I saw the image of Jesus burned into a well done steak.  I actually feel a bit bad for the guy because I really think might have some mental health issues that stem from nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4366	I spent hours trying to teach my cat to do this.  He failed miserably at first and I soon realized that he learned a lot faster if he was hungry.  I decided not to feed him for almost two days and he IMMEDIATELY caught on and was slapping the bell non-stop to get treats.  He was a really smart cat but sadly he passed back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4367	I saw her at a party after WonderCon 2016 and she was AMAZING.  Her voice is perfectly annoying and her mannerisms are very comical.  The only issue was that she had a real goldfish in the bag so some people were upset with her for that.  It's good to see she switched things up and went with a fake one.  Apparently she's been portraying Darla since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4368	Hate to be THAT guy but this post is most likely a BS story created specifically for karma. This sort of post is basically a recipe for making the front page. I know from experience because about 5 or 6 years ago I made a bet with a friend that I could get a post to the front page of Reddit... To accomplish my goal I created a similar backstory, wrote out a note, and put some cash in front of it, snapped a pic, and posted. I ended up making the front page and winning the bet which was dinner at a steakhouse of my choice.

The one my grandmother inherited had dimming knobs on it  to the left of the lights - it also had a switch to make the lights flash on and off.  I'm fairly certain it was tossed in the trash when my Uncle cleaned out her house back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human

One interesting thing about them is they will  move their body in such a way that it mimics the wind blowing a leaf.

Of course my mom wasn't too excited about my first bike but she paid for my first helmet.

4375	In all seriousness bootleg fireworks are INCREDIBLY dangerous.  Here in Chicago there were kids making their own and then selling them to each other at school.  There were dozens of accidents due to the excessive explosive materials in the fireworks.

4377	This is some fantastic work OP.  I had the pleasure of meeting T-Pain after a concert in New York and he is absolutely one of the most down to earth artists out there.  A lot of people associate him with autotune but his voice without it is top notch...

It was funny the first 20 times but now I just threaten to kick the troublemakers out and they usually straighten up.

4381	Josh Brolin frequents the coffee shop where my sister works in So. Cal and has an awesome sense of humor. He always chats up the workers and cracks jokes - He takes the time to do pictures with anyone who wants one and doesn't act like a movie star at all.

4384	It absolutely CAN happen here and there are many parallels between what happens in the book and what is currently going on in the US political system.  I personally feel this book should be required reading here in the United States.

There were only about 1,700 of them left in 2010 - and now there are approximately 3,700 of them in India.  They don't have any natural predators so humans and loss of habitat (deforestation) are it's biggest threats.

They would often grope his chest and butt for pictures - and he had MANY notes passed to him asking to meet up later on. Of course he had to deal with it as breaking character was considered a cardinal sin. Eventually his wife convinced him to find another job - this was back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

I was tired of paying so much money for razor cartridges and now I get a PERFECT shave for way less money.

Even though Obama has a clever sense of humor and is occasionally a troll with reporters I don't think he would intentionally pose in front of the number 69. He was actually asked about the pictures with 69 in them during an interview and his response was that in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

Whatever you save on the food you are not buying you will most likely spend upgrading your wardrobe.  I used to wear a size 44 waist pants - and am now around a 36.  For a long time I simply used a belt to hold up my old pants.... eventually it looked like I was wearing sheets for a bed with a belt to hold them up.  Buying a new wardrobe ended up costing me around nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

4396	I had an Uncle pass away from Black Lung.  It's a hard thing to watch happen to someone you care about.  It's very similar to watching a long term smoker struggle to get air.  The coal dust builds up in their lungs and the body can't expel it - so it collects in connective tissues or pulmonary lymph nodes. Even with today's air filtration technology roughly 10% of all coal workers still develop Black Lung.  My Uncle smoked AND worked in a coal mine for 20+ years. Sadly he passed in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

I turned to get a better 2nd look over my right shoulder and then BAM! - Of course the woman I was checking out then turned her attention to my idiot  mistake.  The guy that I rear ended was absolutely FURIOUS... He threw his car in park - got out... ran up to my window and started screaming.  I got out of my car and tried to calmly explain that in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

One thing I found interesting was that the ones marked export always weighed a couple of ounces more than the domestic bags.  My father says this is due to extra nitrogen in the bag which would extend the shelf life of the chips. I've probably eaten a few tons of slightly defective chips since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human
4399	Food aggression with dogs can be INCREDIBLY dangerous.  There are 3 levels of food aggression - this falls into the mild category - Dogs with mild food aggression tend to growl and flash their teeth but USUALLY won't bite.

4405	I was brought in to do some welding during the restoration of the USS Wisconsin and can tell you it is an absolute MONSTER!  I work with an under-water welding company and we were contracted to secure and then re-secure the rivets on the underside of the ship.

This was back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4406	When I was growing up we had a vacuum in the house that sounded like a ticklish camel.  My mother inherited it from her mother -  and my father would get hilarious with the thing when he used it.  I know not many people in The U.S. know what a ticklish camel sounds like but it sounds a lot like nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4407	Coming out of high school I was hoping to be a news anchor - even though I find Bill to be a bit of an asshole I think he is very good technically at what he does.  The way he shuts off his anger for the duration of the take is something that is VERY difficult to do and often cannot be taught.  My father constantly had him on the TV in the house when I was growing up - but I haven't watched much of his show since I moved out in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4408	"There's a lot going on in this picture but I found the notebook to be most interesting.  At first I had a difficult time reading what is written there but I opened it up in photoshop and zoomed in.

4409	Sweden resident here: Can confirm our water is VERY pure in most places.  I did a PPM (Parts per million) test of the water that comes out of my kitchen faucet and it came out around 100 - 110 ppm.  I sent my Uncle who lives in New York City a testing kit and the PPM of his tap water was a lot closer to nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4410	I work at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk and people try to use magnets to cheat the game ALL the time. IT DOESN'T WORK. Old machines with very thin glass and actual metal claws were susceptible to some degree - but new machines have MUCH thicker glass and many of the claws are a cheaper aluminum which will not interact with a magnet. The older machines were phased out back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4411	I grew up in rural Scotland and can tell you it absolutely IS beautiful.  The main downside (in my opinion) is just how lonely it can be. When I was growing up not many were lucky enough to have cars so you would have to walk a mile just to see a neighbor you didn't really care to see anyway.  God forbid you ever needed to see a doctor - the bumpy roads into town won't let you go faster than nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4412	This is a beautiful picture but as a guy who installs swimming pools for a living I'm going to have to say this is NOT a lake.  Floating platforms are included with large pool installs fairly frequently these days - and of course we have the stereotypical pool ladder against a perfectly straight wall. I guess it could MAYBE be a lake but I highly doubt it and I've been installing pools since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4413	"I live out in the country and have a bunch of feral cats that I feed.  We call them ""Barn Cats"" - There are also a lot of rabbits in the area and the cats slaughter the rabbits on a regular basis.  I feed the cats PLENTY of food but it's their natural instinct to hunt.  This is cute now but will eventually turn into nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off heck in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human
4414	"I teach History at a high school in a pretty affluent area.  A lot of the kids believe that because they come from money there are no consequences in life.  Last year I had a kid walk in late with ""In-N-Out"" - he proceeded to start loudly crinkling wrappers and smacking his lips.  I walked over to him - grabbed the burger out of his hand - took a big bite and said in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off heck in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human
4415	I work as a photographer and when someone asks for me to take their picture I go into full on photographer mode. I will first address the lighting -- then start directing the people with where to stand - Sometimes I'll suggest they adjust their posture. Then I'll go into a long series of pics - some smiling... some not. Usually by the time I am finished it is nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off heck in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4416	I work in video game licensing and while the game looks fantastic OP should be cautious about where he shares this. NBC is NOTORIOUS about going after people who infringe on their copyrights.  The reason a Seinfeld video game has not been made is because NBC refuses to license the name.  They have brought literally hundreds of lawsuits against people for copyright infringement since the final episode aired may fourteenth nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4417	I live about 20 minutes from where these guys are doing this - and there are [TONS of bullsharks washing up in that water](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8JBf6HUAAAOsZ7.jpg).  I know people will say there are almost always sharks in the water anytime people surf but bullsharks will bite indiscriminately if they feel they are in danger.  This is risky business for these guys - We haven't seen this many bullsharks wash up on shore since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4418	The last time this was posted people agreed that the chances of this happening were better than the chances of the kid having an extensive magnet rig and solid acting skills.  Yes, the odds of this occurring are astronomically ridiculous but there's not really any magic going on.  Someone did the math on it last time it was posted in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table[.](http://i.imgur.com/DxJxjsl.gifv)	human
4419	My roommate drinks A LOT - he was walking home from the bar one night and fell or got beat up (claims he doesn't remember).  He showed up back at the apartment confused and bloody.  I don't have a car so I called an ambulance for him.  The second he was put into the back of the ambulance it cost 2,000 dollars.  The ride to the hospital cost right around 12,000 dollars - for about a 6 mile high speed ride.  The next day he was an odd mix of furious and thankful for my effort.  Probably the most expensive night of drinking for him since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4420	"Even though they appeared on 6 tracks together Snoop and Tupac weren't exactly best of friends.  Snoop felt Tupac was somewhat of a liability and after barely dodging a murder rap himself wasn't really interested in the ""Thug Life"" Tupac represented.

4423	Michael was an idol of mine growing up so it is somewhat unfortunate that I ended up meeting him.  I was waiting tables in Salt Lake City when he came in after a game.  I literally had posters of him all over my room as a child growing up and had to say hello.  He was not seated in my section so I waited until after he finished eating to approach him.  This was right after the Bulls beat the Jazz during the finals in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4424	I can attest Green Day has been doing this for years. My buddy in High School got to get up on stage with them and jam in Berkeley, Ca - Billie Joe Armstrong actually lives in the Oakland Hills not far from Berkeley so he would occasionally show up on campus for a meet and greet with the music students. He would spend time joking with the kids, taking pictures, and sometimes he would play a song or two. This was back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4425	I'll see if I can dig up the picture but I had a chance to meet The Mountain at a meet and greet during a Strongman Tournament.  I am a pretty big guy and his hand absolutely swallowed mine - and my wrist, and part of my forearm too.  I honestly don't think pictures do this man any justice... It's hard to believe he was just 10 years old in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4426	It was originally thought that this whale was the only albino humpback in existence but a couple more have since been discovered.  This particular whale (named Migloo) has been tamed by a whale watching company that spoils him with fish.  He has been following their tour boats around since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4427	Jamie Johnson comes into the grocery store I work at.  Apparently most people who are as wealthy as he is will have food bought and made for them - he will come into the store and buy just a few items at a time - doughnuts... a box of kids cereal and some milk - he won't accept any help out to the car and he occasionally smells like weed.  He seems like someone I would have wanted to hang out with in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4428	When I was younger I was a troublemaker and quite rebellious.  I had a neighbor do a teardrop tattoo on my left cheek for me. I'll never forget how my mom flipped out the first time she saw it.  It was pretty awesome to have from 16 to 20 years old... Then it became a problem.  I got really good at using my girlfriends makeup to hide it during job interviews.  Eventually I had it removed in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

4431	I'm friends with the artist that put this up - her name is Karen Fiorito.  While I don't agree with her politics all of the time I do commend her outstanding effort in finding a platform.  For her work to even be mentioned here on the front page of reddit is amazing.   I personally believe that the socio-economic expectations the middle class are working with are strikingly similar to those we dealt with in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table. edit: I have a joke contest going on at /r/shittymorph 	human
4432	Logged in just to mention this.  I work as a graphic designer and this is clearly a composite photo.  It's not a very good one at that - if you open it up using a photo editor and do some zooming you can clearly see some pretty pathetic stitch lines.  I imagine this was thrown together by a high school or first year college student for a project.  I don't mean to be a dick but I have been actively working in the industry since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4433	I work as a mason and can attest brick walls have a soul of their own. The lean or movement in a wall doesn't start with one brick but once you get 16 or more bricks stacked you can see the personality starts to shine through.

4434	I know you're joking but Saffron is not just a spice used in food, it also has a ton of benefits for your skin. Saffron has wonderful purifying properties and is one of nature's well known anti-bacterials. There is a lot of fake saffron out there so it's important to be careful not to get scammed. A lot of shady places will sell low quality kesar mixed with color additives that resemble saffron. Just keep in mind that the best stuff is red with orange tips and grown before nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4435	James Avery (Uncle Phil) was an awesome person.  I worked at a grocery store in LA that he would frequently come in to.  I would offer to help him take his groceries out to the SUV but he would usually want to do it himself.  As he started to have health problems he reluctantly started to accept help - and would always tip generously after we got him loaded up.  We would decline the tips but he would insist.  I miss him and will never forget the first time I met him in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4436	I volunteer at an animal shelter and there is a very high rate of foster failures.  We see people get very emotionally attached to their foster dogs very quickly.  I find that a lot of the time when people say they are going to foster a dog they are really just lying to themselves.  They usually want a dog and choosing to foster helps them feel like they are back in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4437	My Aunt had this picture framed in her house when I was growing up.  She said the group had just smoked a joint before the photo shoot and thought this picture would be extra funny.

4438	This is pretty funny to see here.  This is a deli I go to by my house and that waitress is a sassy one.  I tried to pay the other day with a hundred dollar bill and she pointed to a sign that said they don't accept anything over a 20.  I said that's all I have... so she made me change with her tips - 89 dollars in 1 dollar bills.  I hadn't had such a fat wad of cash since nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4439	I work as a wedding planner and someone either really messed up or there wasn't a planner involved.  As a wedding planner we go out of our way to prevent such things from happening.  We make sure to (at the very least) have a description of what everyone is wearing - although I prefer to get pictures of exact colors.  I have been planning weddings since nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4440	I collect Pez dispensers and this is not an actual unit.  I have seen most of the units in circulation and the tongue portion in this picture is photo shopped on. I have all Pez dispensers in circulation except for 12 of them and I even have a sizable collection of bootlegs.  This is absolutely a fake - the Alien unit this image was based on was released sometime around nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4441	I'm a huge Bengals fan and have been following her battle with cancer here on the internet.  Luckily, this story has a happy ending (so far) - she is currently cancer free. It's hard to see anyone battle cancer but to see a child face that adversity is soul crushing.  That was super cool of the Patriots to do even though I've been a die hard Bengals fan since nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

In a week the tide will take them back to sea.  This is a notable event in Brisbane though due to the number of jellyfish that have been stranded.

4443	I'm about as non-political as you can get - but between shit like this and that stupid undertaker wrestling meme I'm strongly considering leaving reddit.  I have been here  for about 6 years and maybe I'm getting older or maybe the average user age is just getting lower but things have changed - and not for the better.  I really preferred reddit quite a bit more back in  nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4444	I'm a botany major at SF State and these plants are susceptible to Aphids, spider mites, whiteflys, mealybugs, thrips and many more little nasty critters.  While this is nice to look at I would not allow this setup in my house.  A spider mite is incredibly difficult to see with a naked eye - they will cling to hairs and spread.  I prefer to keep my plants outside of the house based on personal experiences.  I had a terrible spidermite infestation back in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4445	I volunteer at a deer rescue and sanctuary here in Colorado and these guys are amazing gymnasts.  You think you have built that fence around your garden tall enough?  Nope you have not.   They can jump up to 15 feet! That is 5 feet taller than a basketball hoop.  We have 20 foot fences here at the rescue and I have seen a couple come pretty darn close to clearing it.  The highest recorded jump by a deer was roughly 16 feet back in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

4447	I'm a martial artist and this move is just for show.  The man in this gif is doing 80% of the work here... that move would no way in any circumstance work in a fight. It is more of a dance move than an attack.  It is impressive to watch but as far as function it just doesn't work.  The closest thing I have seen to this move in an actual match was back in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table. 	human
4448	I spent a few years working at the Oakland Zoo and a decent amount of that time cleaning out the hippo exhibit. I can't emphasize enough how dangerous these animals really are. They weigh over 5,000 pounds... they can swim 30mph... they can run 20mph... their front teeth can reach 15 inches... and they are incredibly aggressive. It's not uncommon for them to attack boats full of people unprovoked. Their skin is several inches thick so most guns will not even penetrate it.  We had an unfortunate incident involving a hippo back in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4449	"I think it's unfortunate that this graph uses ""thrown"" ball for baseball - I think what should have been referenced  is the speed when hit off the bat.  If I remember correctly it was a little over 120 mph.  Also a badminton shuttlecock is not a ball as the title of the graph would indicate.  Besides that I think the graph is great.  I'd be curious to know if the data included here goes all the way back to nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."	human
4450	I work as a cab driver in Chicago and side hustles like this are how we are competing with Uber and Lyft.  It's the only way.  Our way of life used to be far different before the ride sharing apps popped up.  Now we are lucky to do half the business that we used to.  A lot of cab drivers sell candy and such - and some even have more illicit products in the trunk for sale.  I make sure to put in as many hours as my body will let me and also side hustle with candy, gum, and sodas.  I would consider driving for Lyft or Uber but I purchased my own cab back in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human

4452	I spent my summers as a kid in Alberta and absolutely love hiking The Three Sisters. The name has a funny story behind it - it refers to the story of a trickster old man who would promise 'three sisters' in marriage whenever he was in trouble.  My grandmother claims to have run into him on a snowy night after going to the grocery store.  I never really believed her... She said a lot of things though before she passed in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4453	Oh my god I can't believe this is being posted here.  I worked on the set of this piece of shit movie as a grip and it was quite the experience.  I was still in High School at the time and thought it would be good for my resume.  My job consisted of carrying equipment from the trucks to the set and then being bossed around by pretty much anyone and everyone.  People (actors in particular) seem to forget that it's the people on the technical side of things that make the show go.  Tech people love to sabotage prima dona actors given the chance.  One time that stands out in particular was in  nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.	human
4454	I know it's a popular thing to hate on Jaden Smith. Usually done by people who have never read any classical literature.

I could NOT believe what had just happened and even after it registered I thought to myself Nope... that didn't happen.  Then the celebration happened which scared the shit out of me because I'm only 4'11 and it was like being in a tornado of people.

Snakes yawn like this to prepare themselves for a larger than usual meal - especially when their prey is considerably larger than their head. Unfortunately yawning can be a sign of disease. Snakes are susceptible to a ton of bacterial/fungal infections due to the type of prey they devour.  I actually learned this the hard way in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human
4461	Super awesome to see this posted here (again.)  This is my friend Ryan.  He works as a puppeteer and uses this gettup in a production.

4462	Yea, I don't really agree with the title.  Men tend to only shave their faces and necks. Women, on the other hand, are faced with legs, underarms and a bikini area. That’s about 676 square inches, or 18 times the 38 inches men shave each day. (And they wonder why it takes women longer to get ready) In addition, women's body hair is finer and grows faster and in more directions than his facial hair.  Then there’s the way that men and women shave. Most men shave at the sink, in front of a mirror.  Many women, though, find it easier to shave in the shower, where they can’t see everything they’re trying to reach (like the backs of knees). They have to depend on the feel of the razor to get the job done. Plus, women tend to move their razors more quickly than men, and over curvier spots, like ankles and knees.  These differences all add up to the need for a women’s razor, designed to glide over skin quickly, easily and without missing the fact that in nineteen ninety eight the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human
4463	Had the pleasure to stand next to Stephen Fry in an elevator at a convention.  It was a 18 or 19 story ride down to the lobby and the first few seconds were awkward with me realizing who he was and just staring at him.  We made eye contact and I immediately had the inclination to ask for a picture with him or an autograph but I resisted.  I decided to go for something much more valuable.  As the doors were opening I made and held solid eye contact with him.   I then extended my fist to him - he looked down at it and back up and me - then bam.  On cue fist bump.  We went our separate ways without speaking.  This was in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human
4464	Unfortunately what we are upvoting here is borderline abuse.  I have worked for many years as an animal psychologist and this will lead to some significant trust issues in the future that may result in aggression as a defense mechanism.

4466	Reptile guy here:  This is correct. When I was growing up they were EXTREMELY rare but due to an increase in successful captive breeding they have become a lot more prevalent. They do take longer to mature to breeding age than most geckos and because of this are generally more expensive than in nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human

4468	Pretty cool to see this here.  This guy went to my school and is pretty popular on youtube.  Also has an absolute deathwish.  He's a really nice guy, just a bit insane.  Reminds me a lot of that climber who climbs mountains without safety ropes Alex Honnold.  Have a lot of respect for the guy but you just kind of want to grab him and shake him and say in nineteen ninety eight the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human
4469	"This is Naoyuki Oi and he has an AMAZING sense of humor. The media is saying things like ""Japanese pool player gives Bizarre interview"" - but the truth of the matter is he knew exactly what he was doing. This is basically him trolling in a language he doesn't speak. He has been well known in Japan since nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table."	human
4470	"First, to confess   The absence of ""success""   Hurts holds me depressed   Yes I do posses ability to progress   but got less and my best is just not to regress   I was thinking infinite with too few words to write   Some accurate description to the meaning of life    To waste time, doubting reasons for existence,   To not wake up one morning having just missed it.     Mystic in my mind on this mountain I climb.   I'm trying to leave an equal sign,   Seeking to find eternal sunshine.   So wrong, so tempting, walked on resenting     This lonely livin', the love I've given.   if death is imminent  on this mission,    I'm hidden one in a billion wishing well wishes.     Well, which is a bitch if nobody listens.     So there's a certain person I gotta try to be   A better version that's locked inside of me    Silence in my eyes is screaming listen please    It feels incomplete, but without a missing piece.

4471	I had a roommate in college that would wear a bionic looking wrist brace when he would jack off.  I only know this because he kept it by his computer but I never in almost 2 years saw him wearing it.  One day came home early from work and there he was in the living room in all his glory with his bionic wrist brace hard at work.  It was one of the worst things I have ever witnessed - this was many years ago now around 1998 when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human
4472	As a Filipino man who is 35 but looks damn near 60 I would have to say you are a lucky duck.  I recently ordered off of the 55+ menu at Dennys and they didn't ask to see my ID.  That was a sad meal for me.  My father (who worked as a laborer until he passed) didn't have a single grey hair his entire life - I haven't been so lucky. At 35 I have almost a full head of white hair except for a little patch that is blonde all the way in the back that my mom always said was a birthmark.  My mother also had a blonde patch in her hair before she passed in 1998 when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human
4473	This is beautiful.  I lived off the grid in a cabin last year with a [pig and a cat.](http://imgur.com/a/PR1EQ)  Constantly had to deal with a bear trying to get the Piggler.  I was 30+ miles from town and I didn't have a car so I either walked or hitchhiked where I had to go.  I tried to grow some plants but the sun wasn't getting through the thick tree cover.  I climbed up in a tree and set up a solar panel.  It didn't give me much power - just enough to watch some TV... usually either Season 1 of House or the match from 1998 when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.  (actually a true story up til the 1998 part - Only had season 1 of House and a pile of Madea movies which I refused to watch.)	human
4474	Hey there, Great post - Your dog has a fine jaw, I was just making a joke - That's a beautiful dog you have.  Here's a pic of my [Scooby Doo](http://imgur.com/a/ABsF9) - Scooby was the longest animal at the shelter over a year and needs a lot of work but we're doing it.  - Take care	human
4475	Unfortunately this pupper in the picture has a jaw deformity which was most likely caused by inbreeding.  The canine gene pool is already limited and many breeders will use dogs from the same family gene pool to create more dogs - granted this was probably a few generations back with this guy I'm guessing somewhere around 1998 when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human
4476	Man is a hero. When I was a young child I witnessed a fight between 2 men in which one man literally threw the other off of a building - growing up I always had this guilt that I wish I could have caught the man that fell but I was just a confused helpless kid -  I'm pretty sure the man who fell had a serious concussion at MINIMUM and there was nothing I could do about it.  I'm glad this guy won't have to live with that - my experience stuck with me even after all these years -  it was 1998 when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.	human
4477	Vet here - Unfortunately we could be upvoting a cat having a seizure.  When your cat has a seizure, your primary goal is to keep him from hurting himself (not the case here). Most seizures last only a few minutes at most, which means he will probably be over the seizure before you can get him to your car, let alone your veterinarian. Even so, he should still be taken to the vet.  You may also want to distract him with the fact that in 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.	human
4478	"As someone who has experienced both the pleasure and pain of playing goalie I'm inclined to tell you ""that's easy for you to say"" --  but you're absolutely right - that was terrible defense.

4480	As a Native American myself it is wonderful to see this wisdom shared here.  Our fathers gave us many laws which they had learned from their fathers. They told us to treat all men as they treated us. That we should never be the first to break a bargain. That it was a disgrace to tell a lie. That we should speak only the truth. We were taught to believe that the Great Spirit sees and hears everything and that he never forgets how in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.	human

4484	California resident here:  When the water was super low at lakes the last few years I would take my metal detector down there and find some insane old stuff. I would sit there listening to music on my headset for hours finding all sorts of stuff just because of the drought.   Keys, rings, cameras, coins - even an old car buried in the mud.

4496	I posted [this one of him](https://i.redd.it/ilhwkos0o4ay.jpg) a few weeks ago.  	human
4497	He is part pit and ridgeback (thats what the shelter believed).  He was brought in from a dog fighting property with 4 other dogs that were put down for aggressive tendencies.  He earned extra time at the shelter with his timid (too timid at times) personality.  He isn't aggressive and is good with all animals including cats.  They suspect he was a bait dog on the property.  Anyway, he did not know any commands and was not house trained - 4 to 5 years old with a tendency to panic. The ladies at the shelter really enjoyed his personality though and that earned him extra time.  I had a rot die a couple of years ago and I wasn't sure if I wanted to get another dog.  One day saw a post on facebook about how Scooby was about to be put down because he was occupying space that could be used for dogs that were more adoptable.  They waived fees for me and gave me a crate.  He now knows some commands including shake hands which he spams me with when he wants a treat.    Edit:  He was at the shelter for over a year.	human

4537	He was in the Tracy California shelter	human

4539	I sing it to him all the time... I wonder if he hates it by now.	human
4540	Over a year at the Tracy Califoria animal shelter.  Longest animal there.	human
4541	Ridgeback Pit mix is the best guess	human
4542	Yes the people at the shelter believed that he is ridgeback and pit mix.	human
4543	He was rescued from a dog fighting property.  The 4 other dogs that were brought in with him had to be put down due to aggressive temperments.  They suspect Scooby may have been a bait dog.  He is friendly with all other animals - good with food and gentle with kids.  His 2 biggest problems (to answer your question) were that he still went to the bathroom on his blankets and that he was afraid of the world - to a fault.  He just wants to hide and stay in a safe spot.  I lost a good dog to cancer a couple years ago and did not want to get another dog... then in July my father killed himself - and suddenly I felt compelled to get another dog.  I was following a lot of shelters on facebook and Scooby's story came up and it was urgent.  The shelter felt they would have to put him down soon as Scooby was occupying space for animals that were being put down and might be more adoptable.   He had been there for more than a year. They waved adoption fees and provided me with a crate.  He is now house trained and shakes on command.  He does freak out pretty easy but we are working on that.  He's a good dog that just needed a chance.  The earned extra time at the shelter was due to his kind temperament - Sorry for the long story.	human

4570	Thanks a lot for your time on this. Ill check out the link. One thing to note is I started up the generator and the outlets all worked.  Shut off the generator and everything is dead.  I am wondering if my adapter might be the issue.  There is a quarter inch gap on it as it doesnt quite fit perfectly on the 220 plug... Almost like I cant push it all the way on.   I'll add a pic.  Thinking to buy new extension cord and adapter to rule those two things out.  I can always take them back I guess.   http://imgur.com/yHWaPQ0	human

I was the last of 6 kids willing to talk to him at the end because of the hurtful things he said when he was wasted. Helped him into rehab a few times and he would be good for a while and then just fall off the horse...  eventually he stopped trying to get back on and pretty much just gave up on life.  He drank a gallon of cheap wine per day give or take.  In cleaning out his house there were hundreds of empty bottles - it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen.  He had a lot to live for - I was reaching out to him and my son is 11 years old almost 12 - He had family... just couldn't quit the booze.    :(  Best of luck to this guy.

4594	Alright - So my trainhopping story even though I'm late for this party.  - Salt Lake City 2001 - Up in the Avenues drinking Jungle Juice at a dying down party around 1AM.  My buddy Little John and I decide we want to walk the 2 miles downtown and hop a train leaving Salt Lake.  We fill up his camelbak with Jungle Juice and grab the remainder of a bottle of tequila - Made the walk to the train station - Waiting in the train yard for a train to leave - neither of us had done this before....  We hide in the bushes and wait for a train to come by with an open box car.  Sure enough one does - We run and hop in - tuck away in the shadow of the car.  We wait until the lights of the city fade - and we end up towards Provo - going through a lot of cowfields - We decide its best to finish the tequila stat and drink some jungle juice.  We completed those tasks and watched the beautiful night fly by as we roared across rural Utah - Fast forward an hour or 2 - almost dozing off - and the train comes to a stop - we realize we are in another train yard and we hop off and hide in some bushes along the fence.  We see a few guys working... decide we need to hop another train stat and keep going.  Well, no train came by for what seemed like a long time.  We creep around to the other side of the yard and wait - finally a train comes by and we get up along side of it waiting for an open boxcar - Nope.  No open boxcar - and by the time the final car went by we had been spotted by a yardbull - He yelled at us ( i had heard they could be violent) - I told Little John lets go dude - and we grabbed onto the ladder on the caboose.  There is a ladder that just sits there - and it was a dump car we couldnt tell if it was open or not - so we just hung onto this metal ladder - Little John above me and me on the 2nd rung wrapped around this metal contraption as best i could.  The train took off about 70 MPH heading towards what I believe was Las Vegas - The turns in the track were violent - and we were starting to get beaten up - but could not just jump off the train at that speed - so we went and went and went - after an hour I told Little John Im cold and scared - and he said he was too - So he pulled his flipphone out of his pocket and called 911.  He told dispatch please save our stupid asses - and they asked what train we were on - and we had no idea - and they couldn't help us - eventually the train stopped - we got off and walked sorely to the nearest highway - half drunk half asleep - complete idiots - we hitchhiked home.  The End  TLDR:  Drunkenly hopped a train with no planning.  Got into a precarious position on a speeding train - Tried to call the cops for help - they couldnt help - Shamefully hitchhiked home when the train stopped  Edit:  Glad a few of you caught this - I haven't talked to Little John in about 15 years - Another one of my accomplishments with Little John was stealing a car from a car thief who ran out of gas in his stolen car - I was a huge idiot at that point in my life like you might live before you know what it's like in jail. If any of you know a Little John from Salt Lake City please tell him to hit me up here --  far as trouble I still have a lust for life - but my edges a bit more rounded.

4635	Thank you for submitting to /r/AndroidGaming.  This post has been removed because it is a game, device or help request. A game request is any post that prompts users to suggest games, even if the wording might not sound like it. This may include asking for opinions on a specific game. Making a submission asking for help choosing a device or getting tech support is also not allowed.  Please make your request in the [**official general discussion thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidgaming/about/sticky?num=1) or post to other subreddits like /r/gamingsuggestions, /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame, /r/PickAnAndroidForMe or /r/AskGames instead.  Alternatively, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7y4NGZ4) and ask in the `#recommendations` channel.  This rule exists to prevent the front page being clogged up with game request posts helping new games &amp; news to be seen.

A game request is any post that prompts users to suggest games, even if the wording might not sound like it. This may include asking for opinions on a specific game. Making a submission asking for help choosing a device or getting tech support is also not allowed.  Please make your request in the [**official general discussion thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidgaming/about/sticky?num=1) or post to other subreddits like /r/gamingsuggestions, /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame, /r/PickAnAndroidForMe or /r/AskGames instead.  Alternatively, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7y4NGZ4) and ask in the `#recommendations` channel.  This rule exists to prevent the front page being clogged up with game request posts helping new games &amp; news to be seen.

4855	I mod a few large subreddits (e.g. /r/android is 1m+), and we hold all of our mods to a high standard and check each other's work. I get it, I'm the enemy etc, look past that!   The bad actions are all you'll see in this kind of sub due to the nature of it. The thousands of rule breaking posts that get correctly removed you won't see, because that's the whole point. Most mods commit hundreds / thousands of actions per month, with that in mind the ratio of mistakes to correct actions is pretty damn good!  But, you do have a point. I don't participate in any political subreddits, mostly because I find it pointless trying to change the minds of people who have already made them. God knows why I comment here, sucker for punishment perhaps.  Thanks for engaging btw, and not just downvoting an opinion differing from your own.	human
4856	Thank you for submitting to /r/AndroidGaming.  This post has been removed because it is a game, device or help request. A game request is any post that prompts users to suggest games, even if the wording might not sound like it. This may include asking for opinions on a specific game. Making a submission asking for help choosing a device or getting tech support is also not allowed.  Please make your request in the [**official general discussion thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidgaming/about/sticky?num=1) or post to other subreddits like /r/gamingsuggestions, /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame, /r/PickAnAndroidForMe or /r/AskGames instead.  This rule exists to prevent the front page being clogged up with game request posts helping new games &amp; news to be seen.

There's so, so many supportive and friendly communities (e.g. /r/2007scape, /r/books, etc) though, that saying the ""vast majority"" of mods are on power trips doesn't feel accurate. Additionally, a single / few incidents by a specific mod doesn't negate the rest of the mod team / their usual actions."	human
4859	I said partially, so both can be true!	human
4860	&gt; The vast majority of mods on this website are on blatant powertrips, default/main subreddits being particularly bad.  I feel that's a very, very disingenuous statement. The vast majority of communities have been growing for years partially due to consistent and responsible moderation. A few bad apples don't mean the entire system is tainted.  The ratio may be higher in political subreddits, absolutely, but for almost all gaming / crafts subreddits there's very very few issues of moderator power abuse.	human
4861	To clarify, tools making it easier for mods to do their jobs somehow means they're more likely to do some bad modding?  If anything, I'd argue giving moderators an easier time will lead to them feeling less alone and independent / abandoned by reddit, and therefore performing their duties better. 	human

5019	Glad you found a workaround!  Yep, you're correct, something on your end is blocking a bit of code reddit needs to save the wiki. I use uBlock too, and it sometimes causes issues with sites, I haven't noticed it on reddit though... perhaps update your filter lists in the uBlock options?  Checking the console also provides super helpful information for anybody trying to fix the issue!	human

5127	Thank you for submitting to /r/AndroidGaming.  This post has been removed because it is a game, device or help request. A game request is any post that prompts users to suggest games, even if the wording might not sound like it. This may include asking for opinions on a specific game. Making a submission asking for help choosing a device or getting tech support is also not allowed.  Please make your request in the [**official general discussion thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidgaming/about/sticky?num=1) or post to other subreddits like /r/gamingsuggestions, /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame, /r/PickAnAndroidForMe or /r/AskGames instead.

Making a submission asking for help choosing a device or getting tech support is also not allowed.  Please make your request in the [**official general discussion thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidgaming/about/sticky?num=1) or post to other subreddits like /r/gamingsuggestions, /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame, /r/PickAnAndroidForMe or /r/AskGames instead.  This rule exists to prevent the front page being clogged up with game request posts helping new games &amp; news to be seen.

5227	Was this entire post a setup for your pun?	human
5228	Tbh I found the Spotify implementation unusable. Even just being able to click the non-Spotify album name and view all local files with that album name would be a massive improvement, instead of a massive list of everything added.  Also, being unable to rename songs / albums / add album art / whatever, feels like I'd be better off just copying my mp3s around! GPM is pretty good, just too invested in Spotify (playlists) at this point to jump ship.	human

5313	"&gt; The History section of the official Slusho! site claims the ingredient was ""discovered on the deep ocean floor, under amazing pressure and extreme cold"", perhaps giving it some relation to the monster or more specifically the parasites as one of the quotes in the Happy Talk section says ""Slusho! makes my stomach explode with happiness!"".

5344	Thank you for submitting to /r/AndroidGaming.  This post has been removed because it is a game, device or help request. A game request is any post that prompts users to suggest games, even if the wording might not sound like it. This may include asking for opinions on a specific game. Making a submission asking for help choosing a device or getting tech support is also not allowed.  Please make your request in the [**official general discussion thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidgaming/about/sticky?num=1) or post to other subreddits like /r/gamingsuggestions, /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame, /r/PickAnAndroidForMe or /r/AskGames instead.

The only way to distribute a game here is through an official Play Store link, or another major app store like Amazon.

5432	"[Dungeon Raid has been discussed before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/5cqrrg/what_happened_to_dungeon_raid/). Essentially, what happened is the developer said he had to ""go away for a few months"" in around 2012, and... never worked on Dungeon Raid again.  He's released new games since then (""I Keep Having This Dream""), but only on iOS, so it looks like he's moved on from Android development.  Hopefully the app being completely removed prompts him to do the steps required to reinstate it, but I wouldn't hold out hope!"	human

5475	Absolutely, which is why whenever we work with companies (e.g. the OnePlus giveaway), we're very careful to stay neutral.  Many of this sub's members have very, very strong viewpoints on some issues, meaning it's next to impossible to determine someone paid to argue, and someone who just enjoys arguing.	human
5476	We'll avoid doing that if at all possible, although obviously if it hits /r/all then it's pretty obvious why we'll have to.  /r/Android are well behaved in general though, so it's okay for now!	human
5477	I'm not sure there's really a solution to this though. People have different opinions, and agendas. It's not our place to censor viewpoints etc, so instead we enforce high quality sources regardless of pro / anti Google stance.  If you've got ideas for further steps, we're definitely listening, especially in this thread!	human
5478	Hey,  We only blacklist a domain (either manually, or through our third party tools) when it's been used excessively for self promotion, and warnings have been ignored.

5606	Down voted for blog spam.  Look at Hejhaj's history of submissions.  His submissions are all from the same site and they are all usually ripped off from some one else's article. Hate to sound preachy but spammers like this are knocking the coolness of science reddit down quite a few pegs.	human
5607	I never thought news of a cookie could bum me out.  I love those things.	human
5608	Damned I know its expensive to be diabetic.  I am a type I and it can cost a pretty penny.  But I didn't think the numbers would be that high for the US.	human
5609	I would imagine its mainly the skill to figuring out what area the object would be in and just combing it.  You can see a satellite with the naked eye and they had to fit it in a rocket or shuttle.  While many satellites unfold solar panels they are still small, some smaller than a car.  With the aid of a telescope if you knew where to look I bet you could see the bag with any good quality hobby scope.	human
5610	First off we don't even know if this could be legally defined as hacking,  while many of the people on reddit lean towards not hacking, we aren't legal experts and unfortunately the law really isn't always fair.  But I think he was referring to the fact that this case may be completely without any base.  If that is the case then he could potentially counter sue due to the filing of a frivolous law suit against him.  Or at the very least push for the University  to be fined for filing a frivolous suit.	human
5611	A question I would have though is if your doing it in your car is it still wrong?  Here at my university there are some streets that are on campus.  Now if I was driving down the street and had the urge to light up.  Would I then be violating the no smoking on campus rule and get a ticket? -edited- unsure of the civil libertiness of this.	human
5612	Hejhaj why would you think this is science? Its just some video footage.. If you need to there are tons of free dictionaries online, Look up science, learning can be fun.  Stop Submitting this blog crap from holy-web to the science sub reddit.  Please.	human
5613	"because it WILL ALWAYS BE A THEORY! Just like gravity.  Now don't get me wrong I am a huge supporter of evolution but this is just plain silly.  That and changing the name would also give them ammo.  when you don't use rational thought in your arguments anything can aid you.  they will just say ""Because we were winning they changed the name, as to give the appearance of being fact.  Evolution is just a theory that is poorly supported by evidence.  They will continue to suppress the truth!"""	human
5614	"""I'll show you someone who has sinned grievously and can't face it""  Doesn't your book say something along the lines of judge not lest ye be judged?  Beings its been near a decade since I was last into that stuff.. I could be wrong."	human
5615	An important breakthrough! brought to you by this spamming blog with no real data to back up the claim.  Why not link to the source?  I may be in the minority here but I am DAMNED sick of seeing this holy-web crap.	human
5616	did you mean to post this some where other than science?	human
5617	Hejhaj, do us all a favor and just stop posting crap to the science section.	human
5618	Likely no sadder than how any one in the Hindu faith views our treatment of cows.  It's all cultural perspective.	human
5619	"You know as a cat owner it does make me cringe a little bit but still its a matter of cultural perspective.  You can use the argument we don't do that.  But we boil lobsters alive, its ok though their not pets.  Part of the problem is trying to look through another cultures viewpoint is alien.  Neither culture is right or wrong they are just different.  Also your point we kill the cows before we eat them is some what silly.  If you believed in reincarnation would you care if people said ""At least we kill our reincarnated grandmother before we eat her.. you boil cats alive!"".  With different cultures we can either acknowledge that there are differences and move on, or demand that other people conform to your way of thinking."	human
5620	I hate to sound repetitive on every Holy-Web post but this is just spam.  It's a photo with a little info about lighting, and not even original its a blog with the link at the bottom to the source.  Please for the love of all that is good, please stop posting this crap to the science sub reddit.	human
5621	Had a random thought of delivery systems.  I remember reading about using carbon nanotubes combined with two food preservatives (anti oxidants specifically) as use as an anti-radiation drug by binding free radicals.  I wonder if using a similar system could be used to disperse this throughout the body.	human
5622	"DOODLES ARE NOT SCIENCE!  Hejhaj/Tetvek why dont you go make your own subreddit.. something like ""Holy-Web circle jerk"" and stop spamming our science subreddit."	human
5623	I know, its not like a minority of people in a country like Iraq armed with AK's can give our mighty army any issue.  I am sure that 100 million gun owners would be even less of a problem.	human
5624	I don't believe you need a superior intellect to click the up arrow or down arrow.  Also being kind of pessimistic I feel the majority of people are dip shits.. So I would have to agree its not really a meritocracy.	human
5625	unfortunately I do not think that bankruptcy protects you from credit card debt any more.  I could be wrong on that though.	human
5626	I am with Ferdinand here.  I am tired of a lot of the posts that have nothing to do with science.  One of my personal beefs is blogspot posts, many of them I see are just two or three pictures and maybe a couple sentences backing it up.  That isn't science it belongs in the pics subreddit.	human
5627	"I would say that ANYTHING that can be used as a weapon causes tragedy in the wrong hands, from a sharpened table knife to a M2 browning.  It may seem high profile but I bet more people are shanked in prison in a year than shot with ""assault"" rifles by criminals.  Assault rifles are a diversion,  the average criminal does not pay $400 for an AK or $1200 for an AR15 or another higher end firearm, they buy the $100 dollar piece of shit pistol."	human
5628	-edit-  Happens to the best of us.  Cant tell you how many times I have misread something and posted about it.  I also agree, what if he had a couple of crossbows loaded and stacked up?  hell you could aim center body mass then because a bolt will punch through kevlar.  Or maybe it would make people feel better if they were all shot in the face with a .22lr revolver..	human
5629	"As some one who does competition shooting I completely disagree.  It completely depends on the shooters skill level.  Without knowing that you cant completely say.  I admit the ""spray and pray"" technique works well enough for a novice and most likely he was a novice.  But a shooter who practices often enough wouldn't spray and pray.  there are a lot of variables that depend on the caliber of round, shooters skill hell luck even plays a roll.  If some one can hit a head sized target and they pull the trigger first they win regardless of weapon quality, caliber and the skill of their opponent.  A weapon like a ruger 10-22 can come with a 30 round banana clip and it is not considered an assault weapon but has the same capacity as well as the fact it is semi automatic,  it just doesn't look scary.  Also thanks for also bringing some discussion to this topic instead of mindless upvotes or downvotes."	human
5630	"at the half way point of your trip you turn a 180 and start ""blasting"" in the opposite direction.  Of course this is if the object you are approaching is moving at the same relative speed as your point of origin, but the general concept stays the same. if you can get up to 80% the speed of light by the halfway point to Alpha Centauri you can slow down from 80% the speed of light on the second half of the trip."	human

Elemental mercury is relatively safe in comparison to a lot of mercury compounds.  Like others have said unless your inhaling fumes or coming into repeated or prolonged exposure its not to bad..	human
5634	I would agree for the most part.  BUT you cant have other people drive safer.  You know you can be disease free but you don't know if the other person is.    I would say its not a great analogy but it does have some valid points.	human

5645	Nice!  I just started messing with the ATMEGA168 myself.  I am running into a similar problem of what kind of projects to do with it.  With some LED's you could make a binary clock.  I would start of pretty simple though, do things like use PWM to dim an LED, maybe get a tri-color LED and use PWM to have it change colors.  Use an analog sensor like a light sensor to set up a point when a light should come on to use the ADC.  PWM and the ADC are the two things that I wish I had learned sooner.  If you are new to microcontrollers I would recommend at least running through some basic tutorials for your arduino posted on the net.  You could use it to log something.  If you have rodents you could count the maximum obtained rpm's of their wheel, current rpm's and total distance traveled and store that info in the EEPROM.  Maybe make a timer that interfaces with several 7 segment LED displays, or a digital clock for that matter.  -edit-  Moved my post under yours.  When I first made it your's wasn't up yet	human
5646	If your looking to make a simple robot I found this site very helpful. http://www.societyofrobots.com/step_by_step_robot.shtml Also love the projects. That is awesome that you   did that for your daughter,  always great to see kids being introduced to science and technology.	human

Usually the first person through the door wears a tactical entry vest with some heavy duty kevlar,  while its always nice to have more stuff between you and potential incoming fire they don't need a random innocent person as that ""stuff"".

5650	I could always have done it wrong.  Wont lie that this isn't a possibility.  but I tried a bunch of things.  Also took one of the tests where colorblind people see one number and color sighted people see another.  By changing it to gray scale and changing the levels I could see the color blind number on that one.  Though without being colorblind myself I cant know for sure if I did the other one right.	human
5651	As a beginner knife thrower I completely agree with you.  One of the things that makes it easy to start is stay consistent.  always grip the knife the same, step into the throw the same and move your arm the same.  If you get to the point where you consistently hit handle first or even the same side of the knife that is a good thing.    Once you can reliable do something then its a matter of changing one variable in your equation  like distance or grip.  So long as your consistent and only change one thing at a time as you start you can tell what is working and what isn't, where if you are always changing everything and hit blade first every once in a while its a fluke.	human
5652	I have always been fond of the single edged Gil Hibben throwing knives.  Good solid tip and for me the balance is good.	human
5653	That and getting it to sink blade first you have to know the distance between you and your target.. If said target slows up or speeds up then the blade will be at the wrong point in its rotation to do what you want.. Granted it would hurt to get walloped with a dull end of a knife.  But I think it would hurt way less than getting stuck with your own knife that you just threw away.  Throwing a knife in self defense would be such a last ditch effort of survival.  But I will agree if you sunk the knife into a soft target you would likely slow them up enough to win an average encounter.	human
5654	I still feel throwing it adds to many variables in an encounter.  If you miss or don't get a good blow then your up close facing a knife without a weapon, because if your facing a gun your pretty much boned at range if all you have is a knife.  Personal opinion is its just better to face an armed opponent while being armed yourself.  But every situation needs its own evaluation as in its different.  -edit- I realize my sugars are low right after I posed this.. so I hope this is coherent..	human
5655	This is true.  Though I would hope any one in this situation has at least some combat training.  If they don't they would likely be boned one way or the other.  You know, I have missed knife talk..	human
5656	Well it will likely smell worse.  Prices of items you are used to will be off, either higher or lower due to shipping costs, quantities, and how much they can gouge as well as other variables.  Most likely the people will be much ruder and less patient.  Traffic will seem aggressive and fast in comparison to what you are likely used to.  Some benefits will be the ability to get things that would normally never be possible n a smaller city.  Foods and restaurants will be much more diverse.  Go out and try Mediterranean food, Thai and anything else that may strike your fancy.  Better selection of material goods as well.  Living in a smaller city there are things I miss from larger areas but I also love smaller towns.  Basically it depends on you what you will be bothered by.  Oh also service providers will be better,  more selections for internet/phone/cable,  though I don't know if you will be in the dorms your first semester so that may not matter so much.  If you are living on campus though it will not be a great example of larger city life.  University life is its own set of oddness.	human
5657	restaurants and movie theaters are my favorite thing of larger cities.

5659	I would wipe the outside off with something to clean and sanitize it.  One thing I have done with my electronics is leave them in a window if the sun feels warm.  Raising the temperature will help drive the water off faster.  This would likely work in conjunction with the rice, though I have never tried that.  I would say odds are good the phone will work so long as you wait for it to dry.  Most circuits on a phone wont go above single digit DC voltage.  Water wont short that terribly well without help from salt or another conductive component in the water.  That and the holes in a phone are tiny so if you pulled the battery quickly the water wouldn't have infiltrated to far into it.  Also anything but the MCU would likely survive shorting across a terminal, and even the MCU is likely resilient.	human

5662	He is defending a STATIC emplacement.  Any one defending that position is highly visible.  Further more by adding additional fire to the line the odds are that repelling any assailants would be easier.  If the enemy is assaulting a static emplacement they are either there for a hit and run or to remove any opposition from that location.  Red on his shirt is not going to increase the enemies ability to spot people shooting in their direction but decrease the odds of the enemies  success.  P.S.

But the fighting started before he showed up.  Since he pretty much threw on his armor and helmet and got his firearm.  Typically if your already engaging groups of people who are already at the wall then some guy shows up with a red shirt on unless its star trek or the assailants are bulls it wont matter.  If he was hanging out at the wall prior to an exchange of fire that would be a different thing with the red shirt because then he would have a chance of catching more fire coming his way.	human

5677	Well that starchy water could cause you some grief.  No guarantee it will ever work again. Not sure what country you are in but it is likely that components may be burnt out.  120v or more tends to jump across water far better than a lot of battery powered stuff or anything running off of a wall wart.  If you feel comfortable with partially disassembling it I would,  however I am telling you what I would do, NOT what you should do.  Always make sure its unplugged. Dont take it to far apart I would just try to look in and see if anything looks burnt or flat out broken.  If you can see circuits I would rinse them off with some water.  Go to a store and pick up a jug of a highly filtered water, preferably de-ionized but distilled would be ok too.  Rinse out any starchy goo that you can and then let the microwave sit in the sun opened up for a few days.  Reassemble it and realize that it could still have a short in it and trip your circuit breaker or blow your fuses.  Hell shorted out circuits can draw to much current and light on fire.  So basically what I am saying is.. fixing it may be possible but unless you know a bit about electricity I wouldn't.  At work so I typed this in a hurry :P so I hope it makes a bit of sense.	human
5678	no problem.  if you don't want to open it up you could just poor some distilled water into it.  But I wouldn't hold your breath on it working.  be prepared for sparks and fun if you decide to power it up.  I would also do it near your circuit breaker or fuses.  If it shorts out and draws to much and your breaker doesn't trip, you could manually trip it.  Don't try to unplug it if it is acting badly.  To much current can also turn the copper in the wires going to your wall into partially melted burney pain. So better to just trip the breaker.  Or if it does work don't be surprised it its life is much much shorter now.  And watch it like a hawk for a while.  Still not a fan of you trying this.  Electricity is dangerous dude.  but if your hell bent on trying to fix it at least take precautions.	human

5691	"Things can go wrong,  but there is a long list of reasons why nuking Hawaii would be suicide for NK.  While I think Kim Jun Il is crazy, he is unlikely to be so stupid as to try that.  A land war would also likely go better than anything the US is currently doing.  The US excels at facing a unified military force on a conventional battle field.  They do however suck at insurgency and occupation.  Further more the US has been digging in for a war with NK for a long long time.  Remember what happened in the first gulf war the US faced off with I believe it was the third largest army in the wold.  Baghdad had the most defended air space at the time in the world.  They also had a good chunk of high end Russian gear.  That and using a nuke would solidify the world against NK and unite them behind the US.  It wouldn't be just the US and SK against NK.  China would potentially get involved, most if not all of the US allies would get involved.  Even if nations didn't lend military help they would likely lend logistical help in that war.  If it goes to a ground war then you sit on the South Korean side and bomb every military and civil structure you can.  War is hell and one of the fastest ways to beat out an opponent who already is having issues with food/water/power is to remove the water plants, power plants and any major roads/bridges.  The military then gets two choices, run at a meat grinder that has been dug in for decades, or starve.  The list goes on and on in my opinion as to why NK is just going to fire a missile without a payload.  Sending a missile without payload is a statement.  It says ""I could kick you in the nuts so watch out"".  Sending a single missile with a nuclear payload says ""Now I am out of nukes"" and then they die.  There is no real reason other than to watch your country burn.  Think of it like having a rock to throw at some one.  When you have one rock you can hold the ones you perceive as bullies at bay by threatening to toss it at their head.  While you have a rock in your hand the bullies may not come near you.  Instant you toss it your getting the worst wedgie of your life."	human

5693	You do realize.. that if a group takes up a large percentage of the population.. including them in a study is the opposite of distortion right?	human
5694	yes definitely a great list.  Something I would recommend as well is buying meats on sale and freezing them.  The local super market some times has things like pork chops for 99 cents a pound, ten bucks of pork chops in the freezer lasts a long time at that price.  If you have a bit of spare money and watch you can get some inexpensive meat to help fill in some meals.  Farmers markets also have inexpensive veggies.  -- edit -- though those things are luxuries to a degree, they can be worth checking out if you have any spare change.  also great for any one on a budget.	human
5695	Its just a vacuum though.  It wont mop anything up.  If your a dude then splatter is an issue around the toilet most likely.  Least I don't think it would help out there unfortunately.  Though if it does tell me so I can buy one.	human
5696	"To a degree they are.  Though it depends some what on the major, engineering is a very broad term, some have to be more flexible in thinking than others.  A chem engineer is vastly different than an electrical engineer who is vastly different from a biological systems engineer.  Over all though I agree with you.  I think the problem is engineers are trained to think in the box.  They follow the physical rules of the world and are trained to look at things a specific way.  I don't remember what it was other than something on TAM but they asked some MIT engineering students(maybe graduates I don't remember)  if it was possible to hook a battery up to a flashlight bulb with only one piece of wire.  They reportedly answered no its not possible.  Because they always would draw a diagram with two wires connecting it.  They didn't think to hook the wire up to the cathode and touch the bulb itself to the anode of the battery.  As an engineering student I have seen some people who are excellent in what they do but the vast majority are just mediocre.  A major problem that I see is a LOT of the students I deal with don't understand the theory behind what they are doing.  They can work the problem alright and they know you don't do ""this"".  But they don't always understand why you don't do ""this"".  Because they lack that information they are incapable of applying that principle in a similar but different area as well as building something to take advantage of an aspect of it."	human
5697	perhaps part of the training is also for the weapons crew.  Taking the weapon out of storage and going through the correct process of transporting and attaching it to the planes weapon bay?	human
5698	yup,  the kidneys filter out sugar from the blood when the sugar levels get to high.  So a diabetics urine would taste sweet if they were not being treated with insulin.  Science!	human
5699	Very true.  But having hung out with many engineering students I wouldn't be to surprised that some even after getting their degree couldn't make that logical leap.	human
5700	Sadly I don't think any one has ever accused the military of making the smart choice.  Its terrifying the more you learn of the amount of nukes and nuclear materials we have lost or made mistakes with.  The entire history of the cold war also amazes me that we survived.	human
5701	As well as the things that happen in houses.. like fire..  I don't want to wait 10 years to repair a damaged wall.  People drop things as well, what happens if you drop the bleach jug for laundry or even the laundry detergent.  Does it kill part of your house?	human
5702	Most likely no,  but it seems more like a concept home that would be neat except for many technical difficulties and time of construction.  Damage will happen over time, clay will dry, thermal expansion/contraction will crack it.  To me the maintenance costs and time frames seem unrealistic.  Using a small scale ecosystem as a house opens you up to a host of problems.  If your drains clog and you use draino will it throw off the types of bacteria in your water pond?  Also what of dry regions with not much water, open ponds is a bad idea.  Soil types aren't really taken into concideration.  Soil alone is a vastly more complex eco-system than most people realize.  As a concept house it may be neat to pioneer certain aspects of the tech.  While I have not finished my degree yet this is exactly on the line of the kind of things I am learning and that is why I am so against this as a practical application.	human
5703	Pardon my ignorance.  But what are some examples of what Russia has been doing?	human
5704	Sweet, thanks for some info.  Gives me some historical context.	human
5705	Yet this will get upvoted regardless by many..	human
5706	You bring up some good points and I agree with you on the free health care and the children to a degree but the other two are more complicated.  Most junk food has subsidized ingredients and that is the opposite of taxing them, so that isn't the fairest of comparisons.  A Business allowing smoking is something I can see both sides.  But also what of the rights of the owner?  If I own a bar and I want it to allow smoking, its MY property, no one is forcing people to work or drink there.  If my business model sucks then I will go out of business and hopefully get a millions of dollars in bail outs &gt;.&gt;  But ultimately I think the business owner should have more rights in that situation.	human
5707	Well sugar and wheat are both subsidized.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#United_States  Those are two of the larger ingredients in junk food as well as vegetable oil.  Tobacco is subsidized as well in all fairness, but the taxes on tobacco is on an order of magnitude higher.  Also I do not think there is a federal tax on junk food, though that I may be wrong.  Most of the taxes on food comes down to the state level I believe.  As far as the business owner issue I still feel the same.  I don't think it would be all or nothing I think it would really depend on the location.  Like where I live its a small college town and the amount of bars here is amazing.  I kid you not there can be thee bars on a single side of a street.  In a location like this it would probably work fine, but its also a little unusual.  Again good points I just disagree on that issue.  Even if it is selfish I still believe its the right of the business owner.  Going to a bar or working on it are a choice not a right.  It can be argued it is also a little selfish of the non-smokers to demand the actions of a private business owner to do what they want.	human
5708	It is true that the are also used in non-junk food, but I think the point that junk food remains unfairly subsidized stands.  Especially considering that obesity is one of the leading killers in the nation.  I really think adding an extra tax on junk food could be a good thing.  Though then the question is who decides what is junk food.. Sadly it would likely be politicians instead of nutritionalists.  I don't go to the bars really not my thing so I cant give an honest answer yes or no.  But I do know one of the bars here has a huge non smoking section.  It is divided off with a solid wall and it even has its own ventilation and air conditioning separate from the smoking section.  The non smoking section even has its own bar so you don't even have to walk to the smoking section.  I go there at times with friends who are against smoke.  --Edit-- I should also point out its going to be a moot point soon. City is working on passing a local ordinance to ban smoking in bars.	human
5709	Sorry should have explained myself better.  What your saying is what I meant.  It increases the odds of a lot of health issues.  It also reduces quality of life by lower your health.  Also with the entire issue of smoking.. I don't see smoking on that list either.  Edited for clarity.	human
5710	I remember learning something along that line as well in an anthropology class.  There are other dating methods using radioactive isotopes but I don't think they would work for this either.  Also I believe carbon dating only works with organisms.  Living things replenish carbon as they are alive and its when they stop replenishing the carbon that allows you to date the matter.	human
5711	"Well since I am at work I cant look this info up.. &gt;.&gt; It has been a bit since I had to deal with info like this, but I think it had to do with background radiation replenishes the carbon-14 in the atmosphere and so plants pull that in and make leaves and such then animals eat that.  So when the animal or plant dies it is no longer pulling the carbon out of the air so the level begins to drop.  So if I remember right it is that the air contains a certain level of carbon 14 at any given point and so plants that are growing contain a certain percentage of carbon 14.  Its half life is around 5k years old so it works over ""short"" amounts of time where they can compare the percentage of carbon 12(?) to carbon 14."	human
5712	And can you really complain that much about a free registration?  You are using a product to keep your computer safe for a year at no cost but two minutes of time.	human
5713	That and I doubt the military would be united on that front.  Soldiers and commanders both would have an issue with this I would imagine.  Even if its not right away, when a munition lands in their mothers home and kills her they then may questions the motives of the hierarchy that they are in.  I think it would be a mistake to assume it would be just civilians against military, I think the military would also be against the military.	human
5714	Well when it comes to society functioning what of alcohol and vehicles?  I would argue in the truest sense that alcohol isn't required for a society to function, but drunk driving kills a hell of a lot of people.  However history shows that didn't work.. but even without that example how many people would be for banning alcohol in comparison to guns?	human
5715	I am unfamiliar with tourettes but I doubt it is conscious.  It is amazing the results you can get if something in the brain is out of whack.  Some examples of at least weird neurological issues is the book http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Mistook_His_Wife_for_a_Hat Those were mostly brought on by trauma of some kind, but it shows some of the stranger aspects of the brain doing something wrong.	human
5716	"I would still say its  relevant since the nation as a whole allows it.  As a whole though you can usually find an example on a city or county level any law is involved.  That is like saying an example isn't relevant because its only right 90% of the time.  On top of that people drive from dry counties to wet counties to get their booze.  There are many things people do that endanger others.  I am not saying guns are not dangerous I am just trying to point out that if human life was such a concern there should be other things people are against.  Guns are an easy target though so they are a focal point.  I would use ""assault"" weapons as an example.  They focused on them because of their military characteristic.  Now I used to competition shoot with an AR-15.  The rifle alone cost me $1,000 before any modifications.  I understand that this weapon could be used to cause major havoc, but it is not commonly used in crimes.  So rarely in fact that it was considered unpresidented when they were used in the North Holywood shoot out.  Focusing on something that makes up one of the smallest percentages of crime makes no sense.  The average criminal isn't going to sink that kind of money into knocking off a 7-11.  They are big and bulky in comparison to a $80-$100 revolver that gets the job done.  To me a lot of the restrictions are always feel good laws that make people think they are safer but not actually accomplishing anything but infringing on law abiding citizens rights.  A problem I think touching the subjects of guns is always going to be a sticky thing in the US.  To many, myself included, it is a constitutional right and tied with all the other rights we have in this nation.  Unfortunately it is never going to be something with a clear cut and dry answer."	human
5717	"I would say it depends,  some aspects of shooting have very huge physical exertion.  in IPSC pistol competitions you sometimes have multiple firing zones http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbBTC8vjGDg.  You engage targets according to a set of rules then you have to go to the next firing zone to engage more targets.  The events are timed as well as graded for accuracy, so moving as fast as you can is an issue. You have to be in good shape or else you're unable to aim accurately. Also with long range shooting you would be surprised at how you really do need zen like focus to hit a target at 1000 yards.  You literally have to be aware of when your heart is beating.  If you squeeze the trigger while a heart beat is going it throws your aim off a measurable amount even as close as 30 feet(like 1/4"" at that range).  So in a sense you are right that alone does not contribute to your health, but you need to be healthy to compete.  You have to work out and drill continually to compete at higher levels.  Winter Olympics has one of the toughest shooting sports around.  http://www.infoplease.com/spot/winter-olympics-biathlon.html  Accuracy is dependent on a slow beating heart and calm breathing,  the difficulty of this sport is amazing.  If you want to talk about something that isn't a sport I would pick on curling personally &gt;.&gt;  that is one I could never understand."	human
5718	sweet!  even better.	human
5719	I have always heard that guns don't kill people, bullets kill people :P	human
5720	damned for less that $5 you can basically buy that http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9061.  The flash program space is barely smaller than the Apollo's rom and it has half the ram but its capable of 20 million instructions per second and at 20mhz and can do addition in one clock cycle or .00005 milliseconds.  Its amazing how they pulled off the moon landings.  --edited for right dollar amount.. and clarity..--	human
5721	Out of curiosity do you know how the ban affected the business of bars that used to allow smoking?  I am wondering if more non-smokers would go to bars or possibly less smokers may hang out at them or if it didn't make a difference at all.	human
5722	Interesting,  when I get home I am going to have to research tourrettes.  thanks for the info.	human
5723	fair enough.  I agree a lot of the guys I have seen on the range don't just have a beer gut, they got a whole keg.  But one thing I have seen is a lot of people underestimate the difficulty of shooting.  Its easy to point and shoot, but to truly shoot well is a whole different ball game.  To shoot well you at least need to be fit in certain regards, but I also don't think most people can shoot well..	human
5724	Well reddit users rewrite comments for clarity.  Having worked in advertising I really wished that I had the ability to edit things after they are printed in a news paper.  I imagine that online news sites do rewrite their articles for clarification and corrections since they can.	human
5725	Could even be an argument between the editor and the writer.  As far as post not being deleted? who knows.  Good luck with your submission tomorrow.	human
5726	Very cool.  It is unfortunate that the proper gear for any kind of competition shooting is so damned spendy.  I haven't done any kind of serious shooting since I moved.  No rifle ranges in the area and I just cant afford the ammo lately.  Look on the bright side if your alive and able to type you couldn't have been that bad of a ski jumper!  I would likely die trying that.	human
5727	I know.. As a diabetic about the best plan I have is make sure I die fast before I run out of insulin.	human
5728	"hmm that may just work.. Would be like ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Sugar Free With a Vengance"".."	human
5729	Hmm interesting to know.  That sucks that a few bars lost their lively hood.  I know in a near by town they did a city ban on smoking in bars and one of the points of argument was that the non-smokers said they would show up at these places if they didn't have smoke in them.  Well the ban passed and business decreased instead of increased.	human
5730	Dude just move on with your life.  If she isn't happy in the relationship then it's a good thing she is leaving.  It would just drag both of you down if she stayed in it, looking back on this you will very likely think this ended up a good thing.  There are tons of awesome women in this world.  It does suck for a while but just try to put things in perspective.  Start going out and doing the things you enjoy.  Go to a coffee shop, go to some bars with your friends but don't feel sorry for yourself.  -Edit- Also I should point out getting away from her ASAP will definitely help.  If you live together then one of you needs to get out of the place.  Seeing her will just open up the wound every time.  Even if you want to be her friend after this for some reason cut your ties with her for a while.  You need some time without her and the sooner you get that time the sooner you will start to feel better.	human
5731	Another great single malt is Macallan	human
5732	Hmm never had it,  may have to give it a try.	human
5733	I never said it was going to be easy.  But unfortunately all you can do is move on with your life.  You are right though, should have given a bit more in depth detail in what I meant..  Keep yourself busy doing things you enjoy and hanging out with people.  Maybe even pick up a new hobby or read a new book you have wanted to.  I would personally avoid doing things that you viewed as a couple's thing.  You don't need to do things that remind you of her.  I just got out of a four year relationship a few months ago, it was ended on my birthday to boot so I really can sympathize when it comes to hurt.  But much to even my dismay there is no real way to fix this kind of hurt.  Just keep plugging along one day at a time and eventually the hurt will fade.  Personally I found letting go and attempting to move on the most useful thing I have done yet, though hell I could still be in denial and I am sure I wont feel great for a while yet.  But every person is different and there are no easy answers to this.	human
5734	Well if any where in Idaho was going to put up one of those Moscow would have been one of my first guesses.  So how long have you been in Moscow?	human
5735	Hah I have gotten shocked by a color TV, luckily it was a small one.  Was a hair raising experience that had me waking up near 10 feet from my desk wondering why I was looking at the ceiling..  I had been working on the circuits and some one wanted to see if I had fixed it yet so they plugged in the TV and when it didn't work they just unplugged it again.  One of the nastier surprises I have ever had.  Capacitor banks should be treating like a gun, they are always loaded.	human
5736	"Actually my user name got started years ago with a typo.. but I have stuck with it because friends recognize it.  Though this would make a cooler story than ""I was young and didn't double check my name before I hit submit"""	human
5737	I don't recommend messing with a CRT at all.. (though I rarely follow my own advice.)  I would recommend unplugging the CRT and hitting the power switch.  On some it will discharge some of what is held in capacitance.  Carefully open it up making sure you and your tools do not contact any components or wires.  Then I use an insulated screwdriver and just short across the terminals of each capacitor(though you really should short it across with a resistor).  Now this really isn't even the best method.  I am hardly ever interested in repair and mainly after salvaging discrete components in the CRT.    I wouldn't just cut them out of the PCB though because if they are charged that is just to much of a variable for me and what that capacitor is going to touch the terminals to.	human
5738	Well I have heard so much about the soap that I am probably going to buy some next paycheck.  Hope your family can get some rest though after so many orders slamming them.  As far as digg ordering the soap I am never apposed to more computer nerds bathing or washing their hands.	human
5739	Well it wasn't so much a typo as a misspelling.  I was around 11 or 12 at the time and was trying to come up with a call sign I thought would sound cool for some fighter pilot video game.  I don't even remember what game other than you were in a plane and shot at things.  I was going for Mach instead of Mock.  The name stuck though.	human
5740	I didn't think any one else cared about reddiquete.	human
5741	I know for the longest time some foods were ruined by the way my father prepared them.  Steaks, pork chops and chicken were feared food when I was younger.  They were always cooked to the point of extra well doneness on the grill.  I thought they tasted terrible and my jaw would hurt after chewing through an entire piece.  I could see something similar being passed onto meals as a whole. Is it something that has gotten any better for you with time?	human
5742	I found that once I started cooking I enjoyed it.  My steaks didn't taste like cardboard cutouts of a hockey puck and hardly a thing had a protective layer of char on the outside.  I think being raised with lousy food made me enjoy good food, once I was exposed to it.  Sadly my stomach is growing with the increase of tastier foods.  Glad to know though that your broadening your tastes.  Never can really go to wrong with increasing what you like.  Question though, when you say you make pasta do you mean pasta dishes or home made noodles of some type?  because I would definitely recommend making your pasta from scratch at least once if you haven't tried it.	human
5743	Hmm two things I want to add in, one on  http://rmeetup.dreamhosters.com/rmap.php you have a link that isn't closed below the map that shows up in IE but not Chrome.  Two, I seem to be an idiot and am unable to add myself to this.  I looked around and its just a map with no markers.  Any ideas of whats goin on? Even tried using different browsers to no avail.	human
5744	Question for you, what kind of curry did you make?  I have met people who love one kind yet hate another.	human
5745	How could you not like that!  Sounds great.	human
5746	Sweet thanks a ton! This is an awesome thing you have made.	human
5747	If you are talking about the degauss function it likely would have to be on to do that.  If it is on then the capacitors will just start to charge the instant it is done.	human
5748	sadness,  so if I order by next pay check I will have to wait till the alien soap is done before I would receive anything?	human
5749	Oh awesome.  Thanks for the info!  may be a week or two before I can even order, in the middle of a move so chaos is ruling my life at the moment lol.  Always appreciated a good home made glycerin soap.  Hope your family business does well and thanks again.	human
5750	"Hmm I have never seen one that you didn't have to go through a menu to get to.  You could build something like that.. but you would actually have to open up the case and modify things to get that kind of function I would think.  If the monitor doesn't have just a dedicated degaussing button that is.  That would make the entire thing more complicated I would think because you would need to solder into the PCB on the hot traces.  Though in fairness I only familiar with degaussing in principle, I do not know the actual means in which they achieve it in a TV/monitor.  As far as a safe way of doing it.. there really is only ""safer"" ways.  They are absolutely not designed for some one to open them up and monkey around with them.  Its like a safe method of handling venomous snakes.  ""Safe"" still means you can fuck your shit up while doing it.  On the bright side... if you short across the terminals with one hand odds are lower that you will kill yourself, the high risk for death is if you touched the cathode with one hand and the anode with the other.  If it happens the bad way then the electricity can travel over your heart, the ""better"" way it just travels up one finger and down the other.  The amount of juice stored can be damned high depending on the appliance type."	human
5751	I have teeth just for tearing up flesh.  That and I eat whatever the fuck I want to.  But realistically I usually use the argument that it is tasty.  It helps provide amino acids that are difficult to get a full line of with out meat in your diet.  You can eat just as healthy while including meat in your diet and I would argue it is easier.  You do not have to pair the correct veggies together to insure you get enough protein and the correct amino acids.  Being a vegetarian is neither bad nor unrealistic though.  It is a choice that they make and I respect them for it so long as they aren't preachy about their diet.	human
5752	You know that is brilliant.. my sister has her masters in food science. I should try to convince her that she needs to start work on processing a veggie to taste like bacon.	human
5753	Absolutely not.  Something like this has so much ability to be misused.  That and it brings into question cruel and unusual punishment.  Humanitarian issues aside, what of legal repercussions?  What if the surgery gets botched and they lose a leg or can no longer walk?  What happens if the person dies while they are under anesthesia?  These things would open up a field of lawsuits that would be warranted against the government.  I am not a fan of violent offenders but using surgical alterations of a person is a poor solution.  At least in my mind.	human
5754	Well just the humanitarian issues then I am still against it.  I would be curious first off to know how many violent offenders actually chase down their victim.  I cant say for sure without looking up stats but I would immagine not so many.  Spousal abuse usually neither party does much running since usually both are at home and in close quarters.  If a criminal gets the drop on some one then running is also not necessarily a valid way of getting away.  If the criminal is wielding a weapon most people will freeze and not move, even if its not a ranged weapon.  I do not think it would be to effective overall.  Even if a person is not smart it doesn't mean they aren't clever enough to change up their tactics to adapt either.  Also what of innocent people being charged?  People claim rape when none happened at times.  If a spiteful person wants to frame some one they could have that person legally crippled.  To me it is also similar to a lot of the laws to protect children.  It may be done in good intentions but when you have a sixteen year old being charged with producing child porn because she sent a nude photo to her boyfriend, it should show how a law can change.  Also what of having served your time to society?  After you get out of jail or prison and are done with parole you are supposed to have repaid your debt.  This would be something that permanently ruins a physical ability of that person.  While there are repeat offenders there are also single time offenders.  Now every single person who would have been a single time offender (maybe even due to extenuating circcumstances) will never again be physically able to run.  I just do not think mutilating a human for the cause of good is a great road to be going down.  Because lets be honest a surgery to remove a natural ability is mutilation.  It is like castrating people who you don't think should have kids to me.  If you called it mutilation would even you be as inclined to go for it?  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.	human
5755	Hey kudos for doing research!  Usually I am do lazy to do that.. Also realize also that the degaussing coil is not likely attached to every capacitor in the entire circuit.  Some would be used for decoupling, some for load spikes and some used in other functions would not be able to be wired up to the degaussing coil.  So degaussing it will help out but not finish the job.  If one where to start messing with these I would take a class on basic electronics or maybe start with something safer at least until you got some skill with soldering and handling circuits.  If your going to this just don't jump right in.  Least that would be my advice.  Since I got zapped with capacitors that were already drained once, I always treat them like they are always charged.  Even after I have drained them I still short across the terminals(usually more than once) with an insulated tool before I de-solder them.  Once you have done some stuff to make yourself safer it is on an order of magnitude safer than doing nothing at all for your protection.  But its never completely safe.  Electronics can be a fun hobby but never entirely safe.  Especially when your clumsy like me.  I am always stoked when I don't burn myself with the soldering iron.  Heh also lock up pets!  cant stress that enough.  My cat gets curious and has a habit of tugging on the cord of my soldering iron when I am not paying attention.  One of the many ways I have gotten burned.	human
5756	So true.  They are also great for parts if you tinker with electronics even if they are broken.	human
5757	"It could also be reddit.  I have noticed that if it thinks I am upvoting to many things or downvoting to many things it counters my vote.  So if I upvote it auto downvotes to keep things ""fair""."	human
5758	It is to stop bots from unfairly voting people up/down.  But it pisses me off because if I do nothing but downvote people who are spammers(or that I perceive as such) then my votes no longer count.  I think its a system that will have a bad result either way.  Bots are bad, but I also think its bad when I lose my vote.	human
5759	I have heard that it is an auto system, though I have not heard from the devs.  But I have also tried it out.  Used to be a guy I downvoted religiously in science because it was usually a link to a blog with a few pictures and no story.  Any ways I would notice if I downvoted him early on it would go from +1 to +2/-1 when I refreshed.  I would then change my vote and refresh again and it would just go back to +1.  Now it is a possibility that people could just be voting at the exact same time in the exact opposite direction, but when I would do it 5-6 times in a row it is highly improbable.  Now of course this doesn't prove anything, but I have done this on multiple occasions and then each occasion multiple times in a row.  That is enough for me to believe that such a system is in place.  And of course a majority of the downvotes are probably honest to goodness downvotes.  I was just saying that it is not necessarily as high as believed.	human
5760	Hell the animals also have a good chance of survival when hunted.  I know at least I only get game every few years.  Also the majority get away or else there wouldn't be a season on that species next year.  Its not like a slaughter house animal has a shot at not being dinner.	human
5761	can't it be both?	human
5762	Hell if you did that, I bet people would be afraid to steal stuff from you guys again.	human
5763	"Maybe finish up by yelling something like ""CROSS ME AGAIN AND YOUR BLOOD WILL FLOW!"""	human
5764	And the movie District 9 has nothing to do with science.	human
5765	This is a sub reddit for science.  As in discoveries and the like.  It would be like posting something on a meth head beating up his girlfriend in the politics sub reddit.  The laws that they arrested him on are related to politics but the story itself shouldn't be in that sub reddit.  There is a sci-fi subreddit though.	human
5766	But we should be interested in this.  If he is losing his right to freedom of speech for something you consider trivial, it is always possible to lose it for something you consider vital.	human
5767	It is also the freedom of speech that allows us to fight against things like torture, illegal wars and the like.	human
5768	"I can see where you are coming from but they are all connected.  Without the first amendment then there are no legal peaceful means to fight the other injustices.  As a matter of principle this is something that you need to fight on all fronts. I would liken it to a battle.  If the line fails on one front it can fail on all fronts.  The reason it isn't ""working"" as you put it isn't due to the freedom of speech.  It is due to the apathy of the average american if you ask me.  Unfortunately if freedom of speech goes completely out the window then there is no good means to sway the people.  What needs to be done is almost a marketing campaign to try to sway the people."	human
5769	Do you need a reason for freedom of speech?  What if I am in charge and personally feel there is no reason to complain about taxes.  I do not think freedom of speech needs a reason, other wise it is not free.  It would be the right to say stuff only if other people feel your opinion is valid.	human
5770	That and crops take up a lot of water.  It could also reduce their food production while their population increases.	human
5771	One of the main issues is hydrogenated fats/oils.  They interact with each other differently than naturally occurring fats and oils.  One of the reasons there has been such a move away from these.  The body has no good way of dealing with the artificially modified fats/oils where as it has at least a method of dealing with the naturally occurring stuff.  Been a while since I took cellular biology but if I remember correctly it was due to the fact that the hydrogenated stuff forms hydrogen bonds easily(thus the reason its solid) and so it gums you up inside.	human
5772	Make sure it is a live culture though.  if you don't do that you will end up with something that could be yogurt, but not might be.  Though now even dannon is live culture, not sure how prevalent the non-live culture yogurts are.	human
5773	Cheap veggies mixed in with ramen, if you have bisquick or baking supplies dumplings made in broth, mac and cheese(the generic kind) with something mixed in like cheap veggies again.  Something that I did when this was a frequent issue is if you get a little extra cash buy a cheap meat be it pork, chicken or beef.  Cut it up into small pieces and mix it with any kind of soup.  You don't use very much, just enough to get a morsel of meat at times.  Spaghetti can be inexpensive.  Start making up shit like if you have extra sauce and some left over parmesan from pizza, toast some bread and throw the sauce and cheese on it for a kind of bread stick.  It sucks and I have been there.  Something though that always helped me was to try to change between a few things.  It keeps the food from being boring and thus much better.  -edit- Forgot to mention, when you get cheap meats and the like the freezer is your best friend.	human
5774	Having had a run in with a cougar(not the good 40 year old kind) I now always carry a side arm when I go camping.  I think the thing that saved my ass was there was a good sized branch on the ground almost like a baseball bat.  I picked it up and just started screaming like a mad man and swinging it around and slamming it into the ground.  When it shied back a little I took a step forward and slammed the branch into the ground.  The cougar shied away and I backed up and we kept an eye on each for quite a while as we split up.  Most predators do not want a fight for their meal.  A fight can mean a scarred eye or something else that will end up in their death.  However some predators acting tough and puffing up so to speak is a bad idea, like bears.	human
5775	hell I would argue that being a follower of Islam doesn't affect other people even.  Being crazy affects other people.  If a bunch of homosexuals start lashing out violently to counter the violence against them, at least to me it doesn't color the entire group.  But if that started happening would it then be ok to criticize the group as a whole?  Two dudes having sex in the bedroom affects me no more than some one praying several times a day.  It is extremism in anything be it religion or ideology.	human
5776	"but to me any one ""might"" for any number of reasons.  I agree though women are treated terribly, but that is also partly due to culture on top of religion."	human
5777	maybe even grating over the exhaust ports.	human
5778	Why do I have the feeling if this keeps up we will end up like the Necrons in Warhammer 40k?	human
5779	Reminds me of Warhammer 40k and the Necrons.  This is not the good kind of scary.	human
5780	Mail them to me.  So long as they are not something illegal like a sawed off shotgun or something that would take a class 3 permit.  I would treat them well and something your grandfather cared for would have a nice home.  Also why does it matter if they are registered?  where do you live?  You getting in trouble would really depend on local laws.  Basically give me a little more info and I can give you a better answer to your question.  -edit-  But I am serious about mailing them.  Most places in the US you can ship fire arms so long as the bolt is removed and a few other things.  I would gladly pay for shipping.  But also if you just want to get rid of them and it isn't against the law to have them unregistered I would sell them, hell even pawn them.  If you have no emotional attachment and just want them gone you could at least get a few dollars out of it.  Or take a class and take it to the range and see if you like shooting.	human
5781	Hmm well that could be.  person I know who always mails fire arms does have his FFL.  edit- Well looks like the sender doent need one, but the receiver does.  At least with a quick google search. 	human
5782	"Also it only covers ""modern"" firearms.. though the exact definition of such is something I don't know.  I would imagine antique would have a different set of rules that would need to be looked into.  Also if your getting a gun serviced your probably sending it to a business or person with a FFL."	human
5783	What sub are you a mod for?	human
5784	That is rather cool.  Hell I will go ahead and join.  I used to work at a knife/sword shop for several years.  Had to learn an unbelievable amount about all that while I was there.  Find them rather neat.	human
5785	true,  but I like interacting with people.	human
5786	yup, luckily I have that end covered.  But really I would tell them if they don't even care what happens to the guns to sell them.  but who knows, maybe they want them to go to a good home &gt;.&gt;	human
5787	I have seen tons of those videos.  It is insane some of the things they put their knives through.  I always loved cold steels Ti-Lites.	human
5788	It has been a few years since I worked in a knife store so I am only familiar with the zytel handle Ti-Lite.  The action is what I really like, and I am am usually not to picky on handle material so long as its well built.  but I know at least the zytel handle ti-lite feels good in my hand.	human
5789	I have always wanted a ti-lite, though I have wanted a lot of different knives lol.  My personal favorite brand is Kershaw.  I love the Ken Onion handles, damned comfy in my hand.  A kershaw avalanche was my first carry knife so I also have a soft spot for them.	human
5790	Yea the design shape is kind of plane jane looking.  My favorite if you were going for just a sheer ugly was the camo boa http://www.gettier.org/knifepics/kershaw_boa.jpg Just pinkish purple on a knife looked silly to me.  thankfully they stopped making it in that color and just went all black.	human
5791	love the feel of them too.	human
5792	It would be glorious right up until most of us die of heart attacks from to much bacon.  But the important thing isn't that we would die, but that we lived happy.	human
5793	I have honestly been waiting for the cops to knock on my door, or worse.  I have a 55 gallon fish tank and a 30 in my apartment as well as I have always enjoyed growing plants.  Now what makes this better is I am diabetic so I have hypodermic needles you can see on my computer desk but you cant see what is making that growlight glow through the window of my apartment.	human
5794	It is absolutely possible that something approved in government can be overturned at a later date.  That is one of the things that is great about our legal system in principle.  As far as what would happen it would really matter on the circumstance surrounding the change.	human
5795	Out of curiosity, where did you get those numbers?  I did a quick search and on this government site http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html it says that Medicare is roughly 3.2% of the GDP or about ¾ that of social security in 2008.  This doesn't even come close to 10% let alone 50%	human
5796	I had a feeling that is what you meant.  Thanks for clarifying.	human
5797	I have been stressing that they need to stop hosting themselves.  It could be it went down with too much traffic.  I have even offered to pay for hosting myself.	human
5798	I suppose I could build them a page and see if they would use it instead.  The web layout is something that pains me.	human
5799	My Dad's wife does.  Does that help?	human
5800	Well I am not part of the company, just interested in helping the family out.  I could ask them if that is something they can do.  -edit-  No, unfortunately that is not something that they do.	human
5801	Not a bad idea.  I am likely going to design them a new site in something I know like wordpress using static pages.  If I can get them to stop hosting their own page and get it on a reliable hosting service I will see if I can talk them into google adwords and MS ad center.	human
5802	I will talk to them about branching out to related fields.	human
5803	Hell that may have been when they actually designed that site..	human
5804	They pay a flat fee for their connection.  All the hosting is on their own server on top of that.  Even then there isn't going to be THAT much bandwidth, their site isn't too graphic intensive..  But thanks for at least bringing the point up.  This traffic is helping me drive forward the point they need to stop hosting their own stuff and switch to a hosting service.	human
5805	I think a lot of people have brought up very good points.  A point I didn't see, I have known people that they and their significant other had different sex drives.  If sex happens more than one party would like they can began to see things, like bedroom fun, as a chore more than what it should be.  It could be as simple as you just weren't picking people that mesh on every level.  My guess is though it isn't anything wrong with you, but just many things that your partner feels/does that do not mesh with the person you are.	human
5806	Some one has been watching to much Dr. Strangelove.	human
5807	yea,  was just learning how to do a few things and never thought to make a wide screen one as well.	human
5808	Why thank you, I am kind of proud of it.  One of the first things I made in photoshop.  I don't mind criticism.  Though constructive criticism is always preferred.	human
5809	-Edit- Heh realized you were talking about yourself most likely.  heheh sorry its late here and my brain is a little slow at this hour..	human
5810	hmm no idea what I did.  will delete and resubmit.	human
5811	I seriously wonder what would happen with a medical condition.  I am a type 1 diabetic and its things like that make me concerned about flying.	human
5812	I have the exact same concern.  Though I would hope that for anything that can kill you they would make sure you were ok.  On the bright side if everything goes bad, your family members could be millionaires.	human
5813	You may also be able to bluff.  get a receipt from any store, show up and say the bike is yours and you have proof.  Demand he gives it back and tell him he has 5 seconds before you call the cops and that you will be pressing charges.	human
5814	Or even do a self post and link each one individually in your text.	human
5815	No worries. I wasn't trying to pick on any one specifically either.  I did like a good amount of what you posted by the way.  I was kind of wondering though how the etiquette of posting may go.  I was debating on unsubscribing, but I do like the general concept and wanted to try sticking with it for at least a bit longer.	human
5816	Wont stop it from getting upvoted like mad unfortunately.	human
5817	I weep for our species when parents can't answer where babies come from.	human
5818	He wants attention.	human
5819	"In fairness you are correct on that.  Without some science background it is tough.  But we should at least have enough background to answer the rainbow question.  I can recall learning that in grade school.  I really hope though the ""were do babies come from"" was not one of the ones the parents couldn't answer due to lack of knowledge.."	human
5820	"I honestly tend to be some what literal and take very little offense to things.  I wouldn't expect people to know the detailed explanation.  I would be happy if they knew it on a basic level.  Though I imagine that if you said ""It is because of diffraction"" then the next question would just be ""how does that work"" leading right back to the initial problem.  I was just being to critical. I just feel frustrated with peoples general understanding of the world around them, especially as of late with a few co-workers.  I do know that any answer can get involved, and I tend not to think before I talk or type in this case.  Out of curiosity what grade level did you teach science at?"	human
5821	Hell I would be more concerned about having a low sugars.  I fear the general public when it comes to going unconscious.  I have heard many people say that they would give a diabetic insulin if they were passed out to help them out.  Any EMS would know what to do, but on a plane with the average person and less than caring flight crew I would be paranoid.  That and 9 hours of a high sugar could put any diabetic into an ER due to dehydration.	human
5822	The added threat of ending up on that mailing list would be a damned good motivator on top of things.	human
5823	Having packed a concealed firearm for years I have yet to use one in an illegal manner.  I also never plan on using one that way.  I live in a state where we have a very high percentage of our populous that at least have the licence to pack.  It may be in the west but I assure you its not like the wild west where I live.	human
5824	"hell the main lesson in firearm safety is ""Muzzle control"".  The reason you do that is even when you are abiding the law with a firearm you always consider it loaded with a round in the chamber."	human
5825	What kind of peripherals are you wanting to use on it?	human
5826	I have a 168 and a 328.  The thing I found absolutely the most useful in debugging is using the serial communication.  I would have it send the info and using hyperterminal I could read what the code was doing live.  Wish I could give you some info though on the Butterflys but I have just never used one.  But if you ever have questions or want to talk AVR's I am always up for that.	human
5827	-edit- whoops hadn't hit the load more comments button.  sorry some one else previously brought up the exact same point.	human
5828	nope sorry.  Just linked you to some wiki pages implying your a n00b ;)	human
5829	You are wrong I believe.  Decreasing the temperature increases the solubility of gases, raising it lowers the solubility.  That is why when you have fish if the temperature gets to high in the water and the bio-load is to much the fish suffocate.  Here is a link talking about temp/solubility as well as a few other aspects of temperature and pressure.  http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/174temppres.html.  -edit-  though you are correct that lowering the temperature will reduce the pressure.  I do not know if that would be enough of a change versus the solubility to matter.	human
5830	That has happened multiple times.  Both Russia and the US have lost rockets launching deep space satellites during launch.  They use fissionable materials decay to produce electricity with heat.	human
5831	and all the time those law abiding citizens aren't committing crimes with them.	human
5832	You are one bitter individual aren't you.	human
5833	Well can't say that I am not bitter myself.  But do you think that over 50% of wives out there are cheating on their spouse?	human
5834	Elastics?  I have never heard that term before.  Another name for rubber bands?	human
5835	Thermal underwear like Thermal silk are good.  The North Face and Columbia both make 0 CFM(cubic feet/minute) wind blocking fleeces as well as great coat selections.  Depends on your budget but at a varying of prices Mountain Hard Wear, Arcteryx, filson and carhartt are all good brands. Gloves, hats and a scarf can help more than you might think.  Cold fingers sucks monkey balls.  Wool socks are non-itchy if you get something with merino wool like smartwool socks, also available in thermal undederwear. 	human
5836	So what?  Of course any group like the Brady Campaign will speak out against it just like the NRA will speak out that its a protected right.  Maybe it is just me but I see no issue with this entire thing, those people didn't threaten any one with a gun.  People with guns != bad just like people without guns != good.	human
5837	I was raised as an Episcopalian.  The mentality at my church was there is nothing wrong with it at all and this is also how I felt.  The bible is something that many people see very differently.  I think it just depends on the persons upbringing.  Same book but many sections of Christianity have their own takes and their own beliefs as to what is more important in it.	human
5838	"no offence but who are you to tell me what to do?  I have been a legal carrier of firearms for nearly a decade.  I carry it most places I go.  You may think it crazy but I have had two times in my life I have been at the wrong end of a knife, I think it would be crazy now not to carry a side arm.  Forgive my ignorance on these subjects as I haven't been following the news lately.  Are these ""gun toting"" event's unusual?  I know at least in the city I currently live, multiple people have carried side arms into town meetings.  If it is unusual then yes those people may be attempting to intimidate and I am wholeheartedly against that.  But has the media even covered if its unusual?  Or is it just something that some one less comfortable around firearms noticed due to the excess coverage of this subject?  A person telling me where I may or may not carry my side arm, that I obtained a permit with a background check, can kiss my ass.  I know that this is likely to be some what unpopular.  But we really need to stop the Us Vs. Them mentality.  Bringing a subject like guns into the mix is an excellent way to derail the current subjects.  You yourself are getting worked up about it rather than disregarding the fact they are not breaking the law, and focusing on the task at hand being healthcare."	human
5839	"jesus.. I tend to vote democrat, is that what a ""conservative fuck"" does?  Because if it is then I am really confused.  This is a prime example of the whole us versus them thing.  Just because I carry I am a ""Conservative Fuck"" and its a good thing ""My kind is dying off"".  I will likely agree with you on many things, just not the item of carrying a gun.  By picking such a heated topic and bringing it forward it is derailing people off the important issue at hand.  I nearly go bankrupt every year with my medical expenses, I think we need to overhaul our system like you wouldn't believe.  The reason I also carry a gun is once when camping, funny story, I had a run in with a cougar.  He wanted to eat me, I screamed all angry like, hoping that I didn't smell to strong of fear, and swung a branch around and the cougar decided I was to much work.  good times.  Oh also I found out my co-worker was selling drugs on some one else's turf.  So these guys wait for him after the closing shift.  So I come out with him and they have knives and want to ""talk"" about the issue they were having with him.  The thing that saved my ass was in my car I had a pistol.  that was the second time I had a run in with people I wanted to avoid, after that I decided I will carry a gun."	human
5840	"If that happened then it would be a ""Cop tazers man fifteen times!  This shit is out of hand!"" on the front page."	human
5841	Sadly we bicker to much amongst ourselves.  I wish we had something that people as a majority could unite behind.  Hell both sides have some common goals, it has gotten to the point if your on one side and the other comes up with an idea it is shot down.  Any more I don't even know what both sides are drinking, they both have their own brand of stupid.  I was hoping that the financial crisis may help, but it just caused more in fighting.	human
5842	To a point I will agree with you.  I do believe that it is very likely some of the people are trying to intimidate by bringing guns.  But the thing is how many people are doing it?  I mean lets say its a high 500 even though the media is just covering a few.  Then painting this with a wide brush is just silly.  It is the exact thing the right does when attacking the left.  We need to stop the name calling and try to open up a dialog to work together.  Many conservatives are incredibly pissed off with the crazy shit that their party is doing.  But by attacking them will make them work together.  We need to grow up and work together and I think the Democrats are the party that could do that.  All we do is point fingers at each other in this nation and never look in a mirror.	human
5843	Northern Idaho.  Yea most places it would be completely out of the norm.  I actually usually conceal carry and rarely open carry.  Usually I am out in the woods if I am open carrying.	human

5848	well if too much fat gets burned it can cause ketoacidosis and that is tough on your body.  With the calorie content her body is likely used to it may burn to much fat early on and cause that.	human
5849	It does not necessarily need to be registered.  It is a state to state issue with that.  Some places conceal and carry permits only permit you to carry a side arm with a specific serial number, some states let you carry any gun you want(so long as its a legal firearm) with a license, some you can carry a side arm in plain sight if your over 21.	human
5850	what's next though.  I mean a hand on a drunk person with some combat training can become a fist.  So I say cut the hands off of people with combat training.  Because their fists can be dangerous.  Also chairs.. those suckers work like a fulcrum when swung.  Greatly amplifying the damage a drunk can do.  Lets ban chairs/stools in bars as well.  Hell there are a LOT of things that could be argued as dangerous.  Doesn't mean they should be outlawed.	human
5851	I completely disagree with you on that.  if a person has combat training I would say they would do more damage with a fist or a snooker cues.  Breaking glass makes a poor weapon that can cut you a bit.  Usually it breaks in some poor shape that is hard to use well, or cuts up the persons hand who smashes it.  There are only 5,500 attacks a year in both England and Whales.  England alone has over 50,000,000 people,  how many actually go to pubs?  Also what is the effectiveness of these attacks?  Being attacked with something and even being moderately hurt are two different things.  To me it sounds like the danger is being overhyped like mad.	human
5852	How is this science?  Even if the kid got things right(which I am not saying is unimpressive).  This is not science and belongs some where else.	human
5853	hell I would be interested in that subreddit.	human
5854	Are we counting microcontrollers?   because if so I have around 35ish.. And if not 1.	human
5855	actually just a hobby.  Messing around with all kinds of projects.  Working on a video overlay right now.  Though eventually I probably will automate many things that really don't need it &gt;.&gt;	human
5856	As well as plastic and a few other things.	human
5857	I likely am addicted, I drink around 3-4 cups of coffee throughout a day.  But I do not want companies to be forced to make their products decaffeinated.  If you don't want to drink caffeine then don't buy products with caffeine.  And at least for me the withdrawal doesn't last more than a couple of days.  I am not trying to attack you, but this is a point of personal responsability.	human
5858	Fair enough.  Where are you from if you do not mind me asking?  Also something that could be done is ordering off the net.  Shipping liquids is spendy though due to weight, and any dry powder drink mixes wont make the beverage carbonated.	human
5859	I wonder if I can show this to my boss and explain I am underpaid for web design...	human
5860	I would imagine it was genuine.  At that moment she was probably at one of the highest points in her life overwhelmed with emotion.  Just to have some one step in like that.

5866	Hate to break it to you, but do you know how much foreign material ends up in food?  The FDA has a limit on insects and a bunch of other stuff allowed in certain foods or how many rat droppings are allowed in another.  There is an amazing amount of stuff that gets mixed in with food that practically no one would consider food.  If you feel like finding out more here is a link for you http://www.fda.gov/food/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidancedocuments/sanitation/ucm056174.htm	human
5867	Your use of feature makes me wonder.  Are you working in advertising as well?	human
5868	I would actually agree with you on that one.. Sadly not all people have even mediocre taste.	human
5869	And it doesn't seem odd to you that they would fly light years through space to stick something up some ones pooper?	human
5870	"I would say its more like taking a space ship to the moon, something that we have had the tech to do for a while now.  Then ""chemically"" analyzing the rocks by licking them.  -edit-  though I do get what your saying.  I just think if they have the tech to travel those distances, they should have sensor resolution high enough that doing the things they do is silly.  Though who knows."	human
5871	Good points.  I suppose the sky would be the limit on why an alien culture would do something.  Hell it could even be like a cultural OCD where you cant do something until you complete the ritual for that task.	human
5872	Holy cow! this thread is old.  Surprised any one is reading it.  Since you like machetes ever try out a khukuri?  Great balance if your actually using a machete to cut through underbrush.	human
5873	Maybe?  I plan on doing a lot of reading up on C.  I have yet to find a good tutorial for embedded systems.  Starting out I have done a little bit of stuff.  Just unsure how to parse the data out since its a solid string with no spaces.  So for a 50x70 pixel image its 7000 character long string.  It is just ignorance on my part.  Ignorant to the point that I dont know what to look into to learn lol.	human
5874	"Sorry if I said two bytes.  It is 1 byte per pixel.  The way the image data is stored in the .raw file is just a solid string.  so if it was 2x2 pixels and all black the entire set of data would just be ""FFFFFFFF"" with no spaces, commas or other ways of sorting.  The image program wants you to designate the resolution so you manually would have to tell it 2x2 when opening the file.  So it is the declaration of 2x2 that would allow the graphics program to correctly display it.  This may not even be the best format.  It is just one of the formats that has no other data in it so it is what I was looking at using.  I have read back up on arrays and I know how I would have it look when finished.  What I do not know is how to tell it to tell it that in the 2x2 array for instance that [0][0] should be the first two characters, then [0][1] should be the next two, then [1][0] the next two, then that [1][1] should be the last two.  My main thought to save ram is once I understand where to start this project.  Compiling a program to lay the data out in an array and then that way the data can be held in flash and only needed when called on.  Saving the MCU from having to deal with the nitty gritty part.  But again not sure if even this is a great idea.  When I get home I plan on going through the last bit of the starting C Made Easy tutorials on cprogramming.com.  Also thanks for the info, so far its helped me narrow down what I am trying to do.  Hope this is clear and easy enough to understand.."	human
5875	Thanks. I think this will help me out a lot.  I have a much better idea of where to focus now.  This project I am helping with is far outside of my comfort level.  But it was found out that I recently picked up embedded circuits as a hobby.  Then like an idiot I volunteered to give my input.  About the most complex thing I have done is take a light reading using a photoresistor and the ADC on an ATMEGA168, then listing the light level as a percent on a multiplexing LED display.  This project involves so much more my head is spinning lol.	human
5876	Congrats man!  Brewing can be tons of fun.  I have been making wine for a while and want to branch into beer.	human
5877	As some one in the process of learning C and who didn't know about this.  Thanks!	human
5878	It is true you need to be more patient.. one of the reasons I want to do beer as well.  Will distract me since I am impatient.  As far as being harder I don't think its really more difficult so much as just different.  If you understand the principles of one most of that will transfer it seems.  You take measurements of specific gravity for both, primary fermentation stages are similar.  They each have little quirks like some beers your supposed to check the hardness of the water, wines acidity is important.  Also with wine you need to make sure there is no fermentation after bottling unless your making a sparkling wine.	human
5879	They do.  I got a buddy who is an atheist conservative.  I think they are probably super rare though.	human
5880	Hey I would like to point out, those two traits aren't mutually exclusive.	human
5881	no no no.. you get a bacon cheese mammoth burger.	human
5882	The lack of it where I am.	human
5883	Maybe it's how you tell them?	human
5884	Hmm I do not know of a good way to do this.  I would say a good bet would be if you have any rock hound or geology stores in your area.  If you live in a large enough area it would guarantee one of these types of stores.  On top of selling things like rock polishers, geologist picks and the like, they usually offer a service to cut stones and gems.  They may not be able to do it the way you want, but they can probably point you in a great direction.	human
5885	My guess is they would also be able to do it if they offer rock and gem cutting.  Since they will already have a water cooled diamond saw.  But its been forever and I have no idea what a place would charge now these days..	human
5886	Also many of these studies do not differentiate legal owners versus illegal owners.  As well as people involved in illegal activities.  If a crack dealer carries a gun and gets shot, then they end up in the statistics.  Even people who tout that correlation != causation they will ignore that advice if it points to something that sides with their feelings.	human
5887	I usually carry my side arm concealed.  But having carried one in the open I have seen a lot of interesting responses.  Many many people are terrified of fire arms.  This is in a state where guns are also more common than a lot of other places.  Some people are curious, others could care less, and then I have seen some people avoid me like a cancer and I have nearly had cashiers try to give me a till before.	human
5888	Like I said this is why I primarily carry concealed.  However there are times when I was unable to conceal my weapon well as well as unwilling to leave it in the vehicle because I do not like leaving a firearm unattended. I know this may sound mean but tough shit to the scared people.  It is more responsible for me to carry it than leave a lethal weapon where it can be grabbed with just simply smashing a car window.  But I do feel for them,  its an unusual and scary situation to many.   I was mainly just pointing out that  it is a common response to react negatively.  Most times I will bend over backwards to make people feel comfortable.	human
5889	Despite having tons'o'karma do you ever feel irritated how the upvotes/downvotes some times seem to work?  -edit- oh also, was it kind of intimidating to do an AMA post?	human
5890	Hah if I used a cellphone while bathing the people on the other line would end up hearing a splashing noise then silence as I dropped the phone.  I agree that reddit is awesome,  I just always hate seeing people get downvoted just because people disagree with them.	human
5891	Space Quest	human
5892	Jupiter would be something that could show up well.  You could probably make out some of the moons even if they are just points of light.	human
5893	I don't think a persons karma has any bearing on a submission personally.	human
5894	Also I find using people with bravery of 30 or below a great way to find the position of the aliens.  They take the lead in front of the rest of the rookies even.	human
5895	I was ecstatic when I saw they re released recently all on once CD.	human
5896	hah thats what I did, I would have them named by the weapon they have, then for certain stats I would use ascii characters to represent a skill, like + for every ten points of accuracy above 60.  Though my most bad ass person every was some one I named Cannon Fodder.  Had a low bravery so I always had him run into places.  Never paying attention to him his stats became so ridiculously high since the aliens never managed to actually kill him.  he ended up soloing a mission because of one of those zig zagging rockets killed most my people on a landing.	human
5897	they were both on CD, but I think the first one was also offered on floppy.  Man I need to play this game again..	human
5898	This is a relatively common thing unfortunately.  Where I currently work they do not allow open carry, though they could care less about concealed carry.	human
5899	maybe because its a cell not a battery?  just guessing.  But you need multiple cells before something is technically a battery.  But damned I would love to get my hands on some of these for robotics.. &lt;.&lt;	human
5900	Mwahaha... The pieces of my plan for world domination are falling into place.	human
5901	you know, that would make more sense than what I thought he meant.	human
5902	Could be the nuclear part.  But I still say that a battery needs multiple cells.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity) versus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_cell . That and it it may actually be defined as an electro/chemical reaction	human
5903	The kettle is one thing I have to go for.  I want to get a stainless steel one but they are a bit pricey so I may start with enamel coated even though I know they don't last to long.  If I like brewing and want to continue I suppose it never hurts to have a backup gargantuan stock pot.	human
5904	"thanks for the info.  I was going to pick up a copy of ""Joy Of Home Brewing"" by Charlie Papazian today.  I have heard good things about it."	human
5905	I should have a Nobel Peace Prize by that logic because I am not acting like Hitler.	human
5906	with my 80mm celestron I could make out multiple moons and even the shadows on Jupiter.  I would say that was the most breath taking awesome thing I have ever seen.  Even neater than Andromeda.	human
5907	Sorry I just feel it devalues the prize.  Any ways don't worry its just an opinion :P	human
5908	One thing I have thought of doing is refrigerating a couple of gallons of water to add towards the end of the wort to chill it.  Though really I have no idea if this will negatively impact the wort.  I cant use the tap water because the mineral content is so high that the water is almost the color of Budweiser already.	human
5909	Frankly I would rather think about the parallel universe that doesn't have Palin.	human
5910	Tidder.  Kind of an homage to reddit the place that named the cat and seems to fit a cute looking cat.	human
5911	Picked up the joy of home brewing.  Has some good info that I didnt know before.  I will keep an eye out for the book by John Palmer.  Right now the place I work sells brew supplies and the only book that looked worth while was the joy of home brewing.	human
5912	I would also say it's an issue with our language being as complex as it is.  The exact same thing can have different meanings when in relation to something.  As well as the fact that geography come into place since different areas will have their own meanings with the same words.	human
5913	He didn't defeat John McCain in my opinion either. The American People did when they voted for him.  -Edit-  Also defeating some one in an election that you were in because YOU want to be president for whatever reason is not grounds for a peace prize in my mind.  Being the lesser of two evils shouldn't give you an automatic pass.  I think Obama has done some good and I think he was by far the best choice, but I just find this entire thing is an insult to people(in my opinion) who deserve or have won the award in the past.	human
5914	I will agree with that,  but ultimately he did it because he wanted to be president.  Also I think following Bush helps him out a bit,  it's easy to look awesome when you follow an act like that..  Like I said I think he was the best choice by far,  I just think that at this time the award is undeserved despite the fact he has already done some good.	human
5915	oh yea.. when I say high in minerals, I mean to a point the water is literally yellowish orange and about the same color as a light beer.  That and there is tons of iron bacteria and sulfur in it so its about the foulest tasting stuff.  I will give the refrigerated water a method the first time around and see how it works.  If it doesn't work I will try the bathtub method after that.	human
5916	I am sorry, I was not comparing Obama to Hitler.  I am always terrible at conveying my point.  I was just saying not being evil isn't an accomplishment.  If anything I was saying that he isn't Hitler.  I just use Hitler as my fall back example of bad.  I forget there are people who really think Obama is Hitler reborn.	human
5917	The Gamo air rifles/shotguns are impressive.  They have some models with built in suppressors some have muzzle velocities of 1650fps.  They are damned neat.  Though the shotgun rounds are a bit spendy.	human
5918	Congratulations man!  Hope things go great for the two of you.	human
5919	The water would be sterilized.  It is ran through a UV sterilization system before I would toss it in the fridge.  Unfortunately though I live in an apartment and I already have to much crap or I would probably have a turkey fryer.  I will definitely keep the ice bath in mind though.	human
5920	ohh our website sucks at the moment and currently we do not sell online.  But the website is http://www.t-state.com  But we will be selling online in the near future hopefully.	human
5921	What did you expect? They are an utter moron.	human
5922	Because you would need a skin graft after 4.5 liters of fapping?  -edit- By the way, welcome back!	human
5923	Think of your ping.  Oh yea I got a great connection, my ping is only 1.26x10^10 milliseconds.	human
5924	also would be great for people like doctors on call.  Want to have your pager stop bothering you? Go for a drive.	human
5925	How would you feel about breathalysers to start your car?  Would keep a hell of a lot of drunk drivers off the road.  Same line of thinking.	human
5926	Fair enough.  I just feel that treating every citizen as a criminal is a mistake in the long run.	human
5927	Wait till they are old enough to make up their own mind.	human
5928	Though people are also exceptional at bypassing things when they really want to.  How is the damned sensor supposed to differentiate a can of compressed air versus a real human?  To me it is a law that ultimately would have well known workarounds within a month.  Then it leaves you in the same place as before while only inconveniencing the law abiding people.  On top of that the implementation alone would be terrible.  What about classic cars or cars that predate the mandate?  Breathalyzers need recalibration to be accurate, the sensors can go bad, false positives do happen with any sensor, how expensive will the recalibration be.  To me that would be a feel good law that wont work well once implemented.  But I could be wrong.  Just in my opinion the blocking of cellphones as a side effect of saving gas would be a similar thing.  Especially since this is such a baby step.  5-12 years to recoup the $250 expense to do this to a car.  At 2.50 a gallon that is a savings of 8.3-20 gallons of fuel a year once every thing is implemented or on average 1.179 gallons a month.  Pushing public transportation or dumping the money into research would likely give a greater benefit.  How much fuel will it take to ship the metal, refine it, embed it into the glass?  That should be subtracted from the benefit of savings,  by that point its possible that it is not much or even a negative.  How many people will the lack of cell phones save?  This is going to cause an amazing amount of grief to ultimately accomplish a fraction of a baby step.  In my personal opinion the blocking of cellphones would be a negligible boon and a measurable bane.  I am whole heartedly against both drunk driving and talking on a phone without a hands free set(and texting is that much worse).  I just think there are many better ways about going about both issues without stepping so hard on peoples toes.	human
5929	I have always been curious about things like this.  But I was wondering what is the strain of mushroom's tolerance range to acidity?  As some one who has had less biology than you this may be a stupid thought, but could tweaking the pH help retard the chance of mold taking root as a secondary layer of protection on top of sterilization.	human
5930	depends on your frame of reference.  If the person who identifies it doesn't say a damned thing, to you it is still a UFO.	human
5931	because without the inflection of voice, it can be difficult to detect in a statement.  Especially when there are dumb asses that would really believe your statement.	human
5932	Ok, that makes sense.  Thanks for the info.	human
5933	Easy, don't go against the Abrams tank.  Take out the fuel truck teams.  The tank tends not to be with supply as much as the supply teams would like.  In guerrilla warfare you don't take your weakest weapon and go against their strongest.  You bide your time, you shoot some one with an AT rocket with your pistol, then you use the rocket against the tank.	human
5934	I hate it when people don't even listen to their own user names..	human
5935	Do you feel bad about what you did?	human
5936	I did not like beer for years after I turned 21.  Though I do not remember when, I eventually started liking some kinds.  It is definitely an acquired taste.  I now even do homebrewing as a hobby.  But if you are interested in trying to like beer my advice would be the same with a disliked food.  Try it prepared different ways(or in this case different styles of beer), don't drink it so often as to make the taste something you loathe, but if the chance comes up at least try a taste of it.	human
5937	I have had many parts of my life that were bad and I feel lonely.  Wish I had some great sagely advice for you, but all I can really say is there are those who can sympathize with you and don't ever give up.  Maybe something you could do to meet people is to pick up a hobby that would involve other people?  And of course you exist.	human
5938	It goes to the whole argument of your rights end where mine start.  I am all for the local ordinance personally.	human
5939	It isn't like they have no training on how to deal with the hazardous materials and they have no protective gear.  Job sites like this are usually anal about the protection of their employees, as well as the level of training.	human
5940	believe it or not I had two different revolvers jam on the same day.  They were both S&amp;W .357 magnums, both also well taken care of.  The cylinder just locked up and would not rotate.  As near as every one could tell, I was shooting at the same speed along the same targets and I managed to pull a once in a million feet.  I was practicing with my father and his friend for an IPSC event at that time.  That being said revolvers are definitely more reliable than a semiautomatic action.  I have only seen those two revolvers jam versus many many jams of various types with semiautos.  Less to go wrong with revolvers.	human
5941	Honestly I do not know the frame type on those two. But the weapons were cool I had only put 1 round through each before the jam, neither owner had ever seen them jam before, nor since.  I have really bad luck with revolvers.  On one other instance when out on the range with some frames the timing was off and so it sheered the jacket off the round and threw copper back and embedded it into my face.  For the longest time I disdained revolvers since this all happened within a couple months.	human
5942	well depends on how modern you are going, one was a service revolver from the 80's and the other was purchased in the 70's.  So at least pretty modern all being said.	human
5943	"again I was the only person in all that time it ever jammed on.  So honestly that is damned reliable, I am just ""special"" that way.  honestly hadn't heard of that.  sucks that they did that to their revolvers."	human
5944	yup, just sucked to be me lol.  I am sure all of those pistols have had thousands of rounds put through them.	human
5945	especially when the UK has 60 million and the US around 300 million people, it should be a per capita comparison at least..	human
5946	No kidding.  Something tells me that even when sober that there was nothing right in that mans mind.	human
5947	The main issue will be when something like a big rock smacks our planet.  It isn't that we will die while the earth is all warm, air filled and has an abundance of water.  We will die when it doesn't.  Earth will eventually not support us, or our numbers.  There is an old saying, don't put all your eggs in one basket.	human
5948	Could have explained that better.  My point was that it is a sooner or later issue.  Something be it an asteroid, pollution, over population, solar flare or something we can't even predict can wipe us out.  Some are much more of an immediate concern than others obviously, like a chunk of rock or a solar flare.  But to me space exploration will solve all of these issues.  We develop science at a much faster rate when we are reaching for something.  During our push to get space we advanced every field of science faster than before.  To learn how to grow things in space and even on how to make an advanced life support system like they attempted in biosphere,  these things will teach us how to solve problems on earth as well.  A lot of the knowledge learned would be useful in more than just for space.  Also, so what if it is hell to live through?  As a species we strive for the difficult often.  Survival has also been difficult through a lot of our history.  We would eventually get to the point where culture wouldn't see it as hell, or they would get things down well enough that even in our culture we wouldn't consider it hell.  The other option would be no one lives, and then at that point it is really just academic.	human
5949	I would be all for that, but that only solves one issue out of a list of issues.	human
5950	It's what secretaries are for.	human
5951	That too.	human
5952	Heck I would say American micro-brews will rival most imported beer.  Just depends on the style.  though I live in the North West and we have a plethora of micro breweries that make many different styles of beer.	human
5953	Like Running_bear pointed out you have a lower capacity.  However revolvers are more reliable statistically so it is a trade off either way.  And make sure it is comfy.  Also that is a perfectly fine caliber,  some people think .38 is on the small side, but I disagree with that.  Especially shooting close range.  Advice I would give however is use a fragmenting round like magsafe.  It does a lot of tissue damage but does not carry a lot of energy through walls, so your neighbors/family would appreciate that.  Also shoot your gun monthly!  Make sure you are competent with it at any time.  Don't wait 5 years to shoot it when your life is in danger, it won't be second nature at that point and you will likely botch up the whole saving your life part.  If you are practiced you will be safer for yourself and those around you(except the bad guy).  -edit-  Also if you do decide to go the non-revolver route, get spare magazines.  The spring will compress in the mag over time, this leads to potential issues with reliability.  It doesn't matter how reliable the gun is, you also need a reliable magazine.  So once or twice a month rotate the rounds out of the current magazine.  The gun will be reliable for a few(most likely) years if you do not rotate the rounds, but over the years it will make a difference.  First few rounds may be fine, but the fewer left the higher the chance of a jam.	human
5954	hahah that definitely works.  You may want to get her to the range every so often if she plans on its use.  I feel your pain though with missing a nice rifle round.  Where I live I have no where past 150 yards to target practice and I always enjoyed long range shooting.  I feel silly having my rifles here.	human
5955	Well I guess it sucks to be a school mascot now.  Also an actor for a play potentially, oh also firemen!  I wonder how specific they were with the law and what wiggle room they allowed other uses with a mask on.  Could likely be used as grounds to get the law removed I would think.	human
5956	Well as far as stopping power I would agree with you.  Main reason I go with fragmenting is I am in an apartment complex.  While I have absolute faith I will stop an opponent, I do not have absolute faith I may not miss with a round in the heat of the moment.  So I go with something that is designed for safety in mind.  Tends to be a default recommendation of mine because most people are either in apartments or close residential areas.	human
5957	Insulin, Needles, Pocket Knife, sugar meter, test strips and glucose tabs.	human
5958	Funny I actually carry a self addressed freight envelope in my travel briefcase just in case I forget to pack my knife.  And then I freak out continually when I go to open up anything and my knife isn't in my pocket.	human
5959	::sigh:: I know, I tend to be a slave to my habits.	human
5960	Pretty damned close to my sister.  I even catered her wedding a few weeks ago as part of her wedding gift.	human
5961	The lengths of the day change through the year.  Setting the clock to the middle of an hour wouldn't keep the daylight constant through the day.  The point of daylight savings is to keep the sun up later in the day rather than early in the morning.  most people are up and doing things later in the evening versus early in the morning.  That way people do not use as much artificial lighting.	human
5962	"It will ""most"" likely be a low enough concentration to not kill the yeast.  What type of cleaning solution is it exactly?  Some I would personally not recommend on ingesting.  But it really depends.  Cheap vodka is a great idea like oxfordcomma said.  I personally use a sulphate compound from cambden tablets.  But that is just because I have a lot of cambden.  Also how much beer are you brewing?  because the more the lower the solution of cleaner you will have."	human
5963	The more I see things like this, the more I consider trying to get into politics.  I am so sick of seeing shit like this.  I know I would likely have no shot in hell at getting elected.  But I think there has to be some way to fix this and it doesn't seem to be with me voting.	human
5964	How many calories?	human
5965	Well the dude did get arrested.  I imagine it was even cops who did it.	human
5966	I imagine part of it is us not knowing what it is like on the inside.  But damned I have stuck to my morals even when my life was put on the line.  I would at least like to think I had a chance of holding onto my ideology.  But who knows.  I would likely have to lie to get up high enough to do anything I wanted...  And you lie enough it becomes habit.	human
5967	Warning: Long winded response, hope its clear what I mean. - Edit- also should point out, I don't know this topic well so I am using assumptions,  with data I could be swayed.  I do not stick to my principles because they are easy.  I stick to them because they are what I believe is the right thing.  Also if you drop them due to inconvenience they are not really principles to me.  As far as my overall principles that would be too long to go over in a post but hell any one ask a question in a PM and I will answer next time I have time.  As far as the topic of drugs that is not what I am upset about.  I am upset about making it illegal for an expert employed by the people to talk about a certain aspect, that they are an expert is why they shouldn’t be restricted.  What if you made the input of EE’s illegal for electrical safety regulations because they said something politicians disagree with?  Or banning any government employed astronomer talking about the age of the universe because it spits on the beliefs of the senate?  As far as the topic of legalization that is complicated to me.  I myself am not well versed on the subject.  As far as recreational use I would not go on a platform to legalize it unless the majority of the population was for it across the nation, or at least the majority of the people who had voted me into office.  Though on a personal level I am for legalizing all drugs for a multitude of reasons.  Medical use is another thing all together.  I feel that if it is something that Medical Doctors feel is worth while, then I would pursue it.  If MD’s say there is no reason for legalizing a drug, then I wouldn’t include it at that time.  However if new evidence came up then I would move to add that drug to medical legalization.  Also safety would be an issue.  For instance if say.. meth was a legalized  medical drug, I would not let people make it themselves.  Because meth production endangers those around it, and as much as I am sure no one likes them, pharmaceutical companies would be better suited for that job.  However marijuana I don’t think endangers others by proximity so I would be ok with people growing.  As far as the safe/dangerous argument for recreational use, I only care if the person doing it endangers others.  It is like smoking.  You want to give yourself lung cancer I will support you whole heartedly to do that.  It is not the government’s job to mother people in my mind.	human
5968	Thanks for the luck,  though I am not actually running at the moment :P	human
5969	"well alright then!  no problem there.  I was just using it as an example because it is one of the few drugs I know of(very common issue where I live)  and I know it has caused fires in apartment complexes due to the production method.  So was just using it for the ""if production endangers others"" example. Thanks for the info."	human
5970	Hmm any chance of getting some higher quality pics? Or at least close ups of things like the hilt?  As far as quality that is something you would really need to know the manufacturing methods.  I can't tell but at the very least it doesn't look like stainless.  The dull look to the blade with a little bit of corrosion as far as I can tell would make me lean towards a high carbon steel.  The style kind of reminds me of some types of cavalry swords.  Quick search turned this up as a British 1912 cavalry sword http://www.aurorahistoryboutique.com/R000110.htm they do look close at least.  That would make sense if it came out of India.  Sorry can't really give you any more without better pics or handling it myself.  -edit-  Oh something you could do is sight down the flat edge of the blade like you would with a rifle.  Odds are if it is machined it will be highly regular, but if it is forged you will notice it wave a little bit.  Though this again will only give you hints, machined versus forged doesn't automatically make one better or worse.	human
5971	You can actually get functional katanas for pretty inexpensive.  Hanwei Forge makes some great stuff for the price.  They have hand forged non-folded high carbon steel katanas that start around 150ish last time I worked with blades.  They have traditional folded katanas that start around 900ish bucks.	human
5972	unfortunately it is to far away to get to.	human
5973	maybe it is a type of Synesthesia?	human
5974	In fairness though it isn't something a lot of people think of.  Also having a mother that was declared mentally unfit I can say with certainty it is also more difficult than you might think.	human
5975	"For the most part I agree with you.  But I would use the F-117 as an example against ""no reason"" to put things behind a curtain.  Using current tech they dumped money into a project to make a stealth plane.  Now they likely would have gotten better stealth tech if they had it open to all scientists.  But then every one would have that tech.  For it to be a secret, you can't tell every one.  It doesn't advance science in that scenario it advances a goal.  So it does make financial sense at times."	human

5979	Honestly not sure what happened.  But I can guess..  The colder a liquid is or the higher the pressure, the more gas it can have dissolved.  So my guess would be that due to the temperature change when the bottle was closed it changed the amount of gas that could remain dissolved.  However the pressure change would keep it dissolved in the liquid.  The instant you opened it, the pressure dropped below the point for the gas to remain dissolved.  Presto, Dr. Pepper flavored table.  -edit-  skimmed your post the first time.. 30 seconds isn't enough time for a dramatic enough temperature change.  so I doubt my explanation is right.	human
5980	Sounds like the most reasonable explanation to me.	human
5981	"Best one I have experienced was with a friend in junior high.  His dad came home and asked him to start up the computer.  After it finished booting up he asked my friend if he could open up a spread sheet program.  At first we didn't think it was odd because my friends father is very computer illiterate.  After a bunch of requests my friend asked ""why aren't you doing this?"".  The answer was because his computers at work had a virus and he didn't want to give it to his home computer."	human

6009	This is rather sad that this situation came to be.  I guess it shows it was a good thing he lost his moderation privileges if such threats have been issued.  Though on a down side it will now ruin a lot of trust people may have with the mods of the AMA subreddit.  Personally if I was in your guys shoes I would try to come up with a way to make people feel safer when doing a confirmed identity AMA post..	human
6010	Sadly there is no way to ensure the data doesn't stick around some where.  That and it would be an impossible task.  About the best I can think of is if there was a legal contract that would allow repercussions over leaked information, and that is not a good answer either for a few reasons..  It may just need time for this whole argument to pass from peoples minds.  I am not sure what all goes on when you guys confirm an identity, can a submitter pick what mod they work through?  Some people have more trust for a name they know and talk with.	human
6011	Well maybe it is my job in real life, but I would go on a marketing campaign in this sub reddit.  Get the other mods together, and come out as a group talking about your up sides, and try to alleviate worries of people who may post.  I have read this subreddit for a while and did not know that people could pick their mods.  I bet a lot of people do not know the ins and outs of confirming an identity.  Hell ask the people in IAMA reddit what you could do also,  I am sure a moderator post could scrounge up a lot better ideas than what I can toss out.  I would think a proactive response would be best for now, then let things chill out and most people will forget this after you guys have gotten rid of some concern.	human
6012	I think that is a great idea.  The more people know the less they will typically worry.  Something I might do is also show people that each mod has confirmed the identity on.  This I imagine would increase trust if they see people in far worse situations or far more famous people on that list.  However new mods or mods with less confirmed stories would be less likely to get the chance to confirm something with this.  But the quality of the site could go up with more trust.  Also thanks!  rarely does my input get called a professional opinion lol.	human

6020	Depends on what level you want to start at.  I started with programming embedded systems.  Specifically Atmel AVR microcontrollers.  Some great sources though are societyofrobots.com also avrfreaks.net if you go with a AVR microcontroller route.  Reason I am so fond of the microcontroller route is you can work in discrete steps.  You can just incorporate a sensor of some kind and display the result on a computer or LCD display.  You can then work on controlling a servo or stepper motor with the results of the sensor.  I found that was easier because there was less to go wrong.  Starting off with many moving parts and sensors at least in my experience sets up to many variables to go wrong.  But there are also entire kits you can get that have everything you need to at least start on the basics.  Sorry I cant give you some better info.	human
6021	if you are logged in, can't you go to preferences and add your email address?   -edit- never mind, guess you need your password for that..  I suppose you could try getting into it from another computer.  Just keep tossing passwords at it some where else.  That way you should be logged in on your computer, and failing to get in on a different computer.  May give you the time you need to remember.	human
6022	Dang those are neat.  Well I personally love the atmels, they are inexpensive, loaded with tons of features, you can get all the development software and compiler for free and programs can be set to run on a different model MCU with only minor changes to your code.  But if you want to bounce ideas and such off any one, I would love to help.  For me software is the difficult part, I am much more fluent with the hardware.	human
6023	I wish you luck my friend.  I have been in your shoes before and it is no good.  Best I can tell you is you know the situation the best.  Think on all the advice and go with what you feel is right.	human
6024	I believe the bandwidth is so low that it would be slower.  If I remember correctly it is due to the low interaction rate between the neutrinos and the sensor.  Basically you have to really slow the modulation down to ensure you are reading it correctly.	human
6025	Now.. from making sweet wine I know that potassium sorbate will stop new yeast from metabolizing the sugar, but yeast that is already active will stay active.  At least this is the info every wine making book I have read says.  So the idea from instructables may work, but I am unsure of the sodium benzoate.  While I partially agree with DrRocks that this batch is likely fubared.  I figure there is no harm in trying a cheap answer, that cider is a loss unless you want to drink it as is..  personally I would take a couple of cups of warm water, and a good amount of sugar, say 1/3 of a cup for 2 cups of water.  Or some apple juice without the additives and a couple of table spoons of sugar.  Then add the yeast and let it go for a day or so.  If there is action in it, you know the yeast is active and dump it in.  No idea if it will work, but the sugar and a packet of yeast will only cost a buck.  Three things can happen, it works and the stuff is awesome, it works and it is terrible, or you wasted that cider.  Now for me a buck and a gamble would be worth the risk.  -edit- oh though if you use just sugar water, toss in some yeast nutrient if you have it.	human
6026	sweet, well I wish you luck.  Tell me how it works out!	human
6027	no.. that is a gravitational wave.  This is a gravity wave http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_wave	human
6028	Well I guess.. on the bright side.. if you are an upstanding citizen and you get angry and take a pot shot at a judge due to any ruling, there is a fantastic precedence set.	human
6029	On a side note. Productivity of the IT staff is down.	human
6030	Unfortunately I am unfamiliar with any good starting material.  But something I would recommend if you are looking to get into electronics is go to sparkfun.com they have tutorials on projects for beginners.  I would also recommend going to some place like radioshack and getting a beginners project book.  Start with easy stuff and the terminology will likely stick with you.  Also any idea of what kind of circuits you want to build? or have a general idea you think would be neat?	human
6031	but there are so many roads of evil you can take...  There is the slowly subvert things, loaded with weapon robots, death rays on a lunar base, drills to place nukes at the core of the earth and so much more.  Would help me narrow down the advice.	human
6032	ohh that is a good classic.  Would also take out every satalite in orbit causing military communications to collapse as well as a lot of civilian infrastructure.  Easy to make a move in the ensuing chaos.  Personally I always have been a fan of robots with guns.	human
6033	psh... you are doing it wrong.  If you already have those recourses you kidnap some one with the knowledge of robots and tell them their family dies if you do not get your velociraptor robots.	human
6034	I want one of those as a pet.  Then I would feel like some one was always happy to see me come home.	human
6035	I think it is at least partially because you see the cyclist, though a driver in a car is much more obscured from line of sight.  But very interesting point, never thought of it that way.	human
6036	yea, but likely not every one has seen it.  Hell the very first time seeing the talk of gravity waves and clouds I thought WTF? also.	human
6037	To me it does not matter one way or the other if he took it as permission.  He was having sex without your permission.  It would be silly to think that by forbidding/allowing something would make any difference if he was already doing it.  Also kudos on getting him to practice safe sex.  You may want to also talk to him about the negatives you feel.  So long as you have a good relationship and he continues having the safe sex, there is not a lot that should go wrong.  Personally I think part of a good relationship with any one is letting them know how you feel.  Now not having kids this may not be the best advice.	human
6038	My nose pops if I tug on it.  Also my right thumb has unlimited pops in it.	human
6039	What kind of foods do you eat on that income?	human
6040	Very cool.  I envy you for being able to pull that off.  Not sure if I could do that myself.  As a side question, what martial art do you practice?	human
6041	Depends on your state, but at least where I live there are some advantages.  The landlords actually have to supply receipts and or copies for all charges taken off your deposit if you ask.  Just most people do not know this and so it never gets exercised.	human
6042	knowing me coming out from the hidden room I would always open the door fast enough to drop everything onto the floor.  But damned neat that you can buy these already made.	human
6043	Ever try a full spectrum or 6500k bulbs?  They are only a little more expensive than a standard CFL but are supposed to do well for plants of most variates.	human
6044	Without any stimuli I doubt that you would be anything other than a container for donor organs.  You learn through stimulus, so being born without any senses I doubt you would learn.  However losing all your senses would be a different matter.  I would guess you would go insane in a short order of time with your brain degrading over time.  Sensory deprivation tank experiments show people do poorly without senses.	human
6045	Out of curiosity what would you do as a better design?  	human
6046	That is pretty damned sweet!  Both baked goods and geekiness are great, but when you mix them they become even more awesome.	human
6047	That is correct.  Just one we have not discovered yet.	human
6048	Dude sounds like you both need to grow up a bit.  You hacked into her facebook account??  Just act like an adult.  Maybe set up some ground rules since you are room mates.  However the screwing you out of rent is completely not cool.  I would have a serious talk about that with her then if not resolved contact your landlord or possibly small claims.  Then when the lease is up have one of you move out.  As a side note I do feel your pain.  Had a fiance break up with me when we were living togethor.  Took me a couple of months to get a new place and some one to sublease for me.  I would just avoid contact and count the days till you are out while trying to be as professional as you can.	human
6049	Any idea how the parents feel about this whole deal?	human
6050	Hell it makes sense to me to distinguish those two as separate colors.	human
6051	Well as an American I can tell you the monetary cost was not the first cost that crossed my mind.  I am sure many others did the same.	human
6052	Well Flagellum are the tail part of some bacteria that allows them to move.  I would imagine since it resembles a whip that is where that whole thing comes from.	human
6053	That would work well.  Though cost would likely be something that would keep most people from going that route.	human
6054	I am just glad he stopped using that spray on tan.	human
6055	I remember hearing something about Northrop Grumman getting development contracts for UAV's in the late 90's or early 2000.  Kind of has a similar look the B-2 Spirit.	human
6056	I was thinking that the flegellum on bacteria was named after the Latin root.  Naming things with Latin names is kind of common in science.	human
6057	hah sorry to be a little fuzzy on what I meant.	human
6058	And that is why I have learned so much even at an older age...	human
6059	"The people I know get 20 million?  Hell I would go with the first choice.  I already am one of the poorer people I know, no change there.  then I would just be ""Poor"" in a nice house, some stock options in a few companies and a couple nice cars.  That and I would feel accomplished for helping those I know."	human
6060	"I quit from a job that I absolutely adored.  I had to because I was going to school at a university in another town.  The job was working at a place called Merlos Cutlery.  I got to play with knives, swords and all sorts of other stuff.  We carried a good amount of quality goods, I also was in charge of razor repair(circuit repair).  The staff was awesome, ""most"" the customers were the easiest to just talk to and hang out with in the store."	human
6061	Oh to differentiate between a straight edge and an electric.  The repair was mainly replacing something like a burnt out capacitor but mainly the batteries are soldered to the board in electric razors.  So the average person couldn't do that.	human
6062	I know.  It isn't like he said he was going to do this while he was campaigning.	human
6063	You can never have too many nipples with strawberries on them apparently.	human
6064	I wish I was motivated.  That is the one thing I wish I had better luck in changing.  I lose it because I find things simple and boring most of the time.	human
6065	In situations like the one in this article, blame both of them.  You do not have to screw some one over, just because the courts allow it doesn't absolve the woman of wrong doing.	human
6066	I work in a small room with a xerox office center.  I at least have heard this is bad for your lungs with the toner..  As far as being worth it,  it is the best I can seemingly do for now.  So really guess I would have to say yes since it pays the bills and there are not any options for me at the moment.	human
6067	"My sister and her friends were having a sleepover.  I am walking to the kitchen and I notice my sister is awake and stop to chat with her.  Suddenly her friend(who had a huge crush on Riker in Star Trek TNG) yells out ""NO! Dont eat that banana Riker!""  then she just rolled over and started mumbling something we couldn't make out.  Still surprised our laughter never woke her."	human
6068	No you can not power a car off of canola oil.  You can power a diesel car off of canola.  Nearly 98% of all cars would need to be changed out for a different engine type.  That alone is a massive undertaking.  Soil is also a limited resource, there is only so much land to grow things.  We are also pushing how much water we can use on the crops we are currently growing.  With our population going to 100% biofuel would likely not work with our current situation.  That being said it would work as a supplement to wean us farther off of reliance on fossil fuel in my mind.  What we really need is a better answer.  Unfortunately we are not spending enough money into research because.	human
6069	what is a gneiss girl like you doing in a schisty place like this?	human
6070	Electric looks like it would definitely be the best so far, sadly battery tech is either not so great, or super spendy.  Only issues also is in areas like where I live..  in the middle of no where.. But easy way to solve that is just have hybrids that have a good range on just the electric.  	human
6071	Call me an optimist.. but maybe by doing that it will lead to them shifting their views once they translate it themselves..	human
6072	Sadly there is no such thing as an advertisement that 100% of people like.	human
6073	I was thinking fusion myself.	human
6074	No, she is your child.  People of any religion think raising kids in any other religion is usually bad.  Splashing water on some ones face when they are so young does nothing to give them a chance at something.  Other than wanting your attention, food and diaper changes I really doubt any kind of morality will come into play for a few years.	human
6075	Something my grandfather always was keen of pointing out.  Ever since the 1950's we have said fusion tech will be obtained in the next decade.  Just now are we getting there.	human
6076	Kind of a cocky claim.  How do you know some one like this guy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u3aShlRoZQ isn't on reddit?	human
6077	Mind control.. duh..	human
6078	First off.. your questions while evolution is related to them, are not in the field of evolution.  This is something an astrophysicist would best be able to answer.  If he asked a biology prof these questions there is a chance they may not know.  Tell him to talk to a physicist.  Your second question first.  When you are talking about spinning a different direction are you talking about the planet being in a retrograde orbit around the sun? or its rotation on its axis?  If you are talking about a retrograde orbit, there are none that do that.  If you are talking about the rotation being opposite then that is some what easily explained.  Impacts with a relatively massive body could do that.  Also it is possible that smaller objects like Pluto could have also been captured by our solar system.  First question.  This one I can only take an educated guess at.  The closer you are to a gravitational field the stronger it is.  So when it was closer to the earth it wouldn't have moved as far away as it does now.  Basically it is not a linear change.  The distance moves on a curve.  So the farther into the future you go, the more it will move away every year.  So the moon would not be as close as he thinks.  Also even if it WAS a linear change the thought that an impossible environment for life is silly.  We have organisms that live in the ground, organisms that live at geothermal vents and others that live in a nuclear reactor.  Life is tough.	human
6079	Wow a DC motor in a razor would likely throw off a lot more EMI than most modern electronics.  It is like they just made stuff up without talking to experts.	human
6080	Well also any EMI loses power by a square of the distance.   The only thing I would guess that would outdo the razor would be anything designed to transmit, like a cellphone or something with its wifi on.  but still.. if the EMI from those systems screwed up other advanced systems there would be a lot of pissed off people with laptops in coffee shops.  But hell if you remember I would love to hear about the results if you test it out.	human
6081	I have been lurking since I haven't had the time or money to tinker with what I want at the moment.  I also am subscribed to arduino and avr subreddits.  I got into it because I have been fascinated by robotics.  My first main project was to build a light sensor and take a reading off of it with the ADC and then display the result on an LED display.  Eventually if I get around to it I want to build a simple obstacle avoiding bot as my next project.	human
6082	Sadly enough fake claims will ruin it for others.  It is not that people will be less compassionate, they just wont think a real situation is real.  Least I would like to think that those people who were awesome and offering liver transplants would still stand up and do that for some one it was confirmed for.	human
6083	Some larger chain stores even have it in the Asian section.	human
6084	Well if it is robotics you are interested in, I recommend learning about embedded systems ultimately.  It takes a decent amount of equipment to get into electronics.  Looking at 50-100 bucks to gather up the stuff you will need if you do not have it already.  You need soldering iron, multimeter with a continuity test as well as other odds and ends.  Great site for a starting robot is http://www.societyofrobots.com  they have a $50 robot tutorial.  Also http://www.sparkfun.com has parts and tutorials, http://www.digikey.com also has a lot of parts.  I am sure if you look around Amazon.com you can also get some starting tutorial books.  If you ever have questions I will be glad to try and answer them.	human
6085	"yup on board programming.  I use Atmel microcontrollers for my embedded systems.  they are little computers on a single chip.  One of the models I use has a 32k solid state hard drive, 2k of ram, 1k of eeprom, with an external crystal the clock speed is 20mhz and tons of peripheral abilities.  It can communicate through a serial port with just a few pieces, take analog signals and make them digital, built in thermometer and the like.  So you program it what to do with what you have connected to it.  Here is an example of something I built with a microcontroller http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR5NfH8WW7w  There are two types of components also, discrete and integrated.  discrete is a single piece that does one thing basically, like a resistor or transistor.  Integrated circuits or IC's have multiple things on one ""chip"".  Like a CPU on a computer is a large bank of transistors,  so since it has more than one discrete components on a single chip, it is an integrated circuit.  I would recommend starting with discrete components.  You can use a few parts like a transistor, couple resistors, piezo electric buzzer, light sensor and a 9 volt battery to make a buzzer that goes off.  I am sure looking around you can find tutorials on this kind of stuff.  I will shut up before I keep talking and cause your eyes to glaze over, but seriously though feel free to pester me, I love talking about this kind of stuff.  -edit- oh as far as a parts list.  Really depends on what you want to do.  I am sure I could find one though with a bit of looking."	human
6086	I also use Eagle.  It is great because some places like sparkfun will add components to a library.	human
6087	In a tub of water add a tablespoon or two of vinegar for wilted produce like lettuce.  soak it for a little bit and it should become firmer again.	human
6088	Yakety Sax.	human
6089	you know.. everyones shit stinks.	human
6090	That is why it is over so fast &gt;.&gt; because it is being fast forwarded..	human
6091	"well.. I do not know if this is the easiest way, but I would get several CD players or mp3 players.  then I would run the wiring from each individual music player to each seat.  I would then wire them up to a rotary switch, then the rotary switch to an audio jack.  Basically then you would select the ""channel"" by the switch position.  Though I think you need a license if you are having music in your workplace where the customers can hear it.  -edit-  also if you are in range of a radio station you could have radios hooked up and just make them another channel.  that way channel ""5"" would always be the same radio station."	human
6092	what is the issue with the * symbol? I don't get what the OP has against it.	human
6093	I decided to make this http://imgur.com/nn82w.jpg  figured there was a need.	human
6094	there, this better for you? http://imgur.com/PNrwr.jpg  I like this one a little better.	human
6095	.. wow I work in a room with paper and a photocopier.. this is perfect!	human
6096	hmm good point... luckily no one but the advertising department uses colored paper, and that is just my boss(would also approve of the camo beer cooler) and I.. I could just leave the plain paper be and make a colored paper box the beer cooler..	human
6097	Well I would be proud to have my own graphic used against me if a situation warranted it :P	human
6098	The only thing that would make that crossbow more awesome is a faster cyclic rate.	human
6099	Why do you do what you do?  is it for a paycheck or ideological beliefs or something else entirely.	human
6100	Wow that is a hell of a kit for that price.  I work in a store with brewing supplies and I would still consider buying that kit.	human
6101	duh that makes sense.. you do not chose what the hell you do in armed service.  What are your personal feelings on what you do?	human
6102	I have a couple of ideas to that I would try if I had one of those.  Tinkering with stuff and only breaking it half of the time is my middle name.	human
6103	I used tap water once and only once.. It was so terrible I couldn't finish the batch of beer.  But I think it really depends on where you live.  I have lived places with great tasting tap, and some with terrible.  Now I just use reverse osmosis water.	human
6104	Also those microwave lobbyists are amazingly powerful.	human
6105	my two cents.. what do you have to lose?  She may have honestly missed the first call.  If she screened your first call and you call again you are out what.. 20 seconds?  If she missed the call then you may go out and things could potentially be awesome.	human
6106	it should have some kind of markings on the capacitor.  If you see any could you edit in the info if there is some?  -edit-  also if you took a photo of the capacitor and both sides of the circuit board it is possible to maybe glean an idea of what that capacitor is supposed to do there.  -edit 2- Thanks for the pics.  another idea I had was are there any other capacitors with similar numbers on the circuit board and/or similar size?  Usually the same exact part is used multiple times on a circuit.	human
6107	If I could make a bit more money and do something to make a positive impact in the world.  To live a bit more comfortably and helping out people as a whole would make me a satisfied happy person.  Hell if I make a good positive impact to the world and my salary didn't change I would still be happy.	human
6108	I will be honest with you.  With everything I can tell I would be leery of fixing this and hooking it up to my PC..  If the part is wrong you could fry your MOBO, also the part may have died to another issue with the PSU.  I would also feel more comfortable if I could handle the board in my hands, and doubt you live in Moscow..  If you want to risk it though I will give you the best advice I can.	human
6109	well hell if you got a system to risk I would try and fix it to see if I could.  One thing about your multimeter, does it have a peak/trough sampling ability?  Because the voltage reading is an average over a certain amount of time.  So it could be fluctuating from 8 volts to 16 volts 100 times a second then most multi meters would read as a solid 12 volts,  so that can cause premature death in components.  I would guess that it is likely a capacitor to get rid of line noise..  If I could see the traces on the circuit board it would give me a little bit of a better idea.  Any idea what the voltage is at that point on the circuit board?	human
6110	When you bring it inside there will be condensation that will form on the inside of the tv.  The cold itself shouldn't hurt it.  But I would let it rest at room temp for a while before you turn it on.  Let it warm up to room temp and give it a little time to dry.  There are some very high voltage points in a TV and in a bad set of circumstance the moisture may allow a short.	human
6111	no worries, whenever you get around to answering.  Follow the the traces basically to figure it out.  Ultimately though you will be guessing the amount of farads the capacitor holds, so you could also highball the voltage.  You can probably pick one up at a local electronics store, but if not http://www.digikey.com has a superb selection and http://www.sparkfun.com has some.  if it wasn't to large it likely was used as a decoupling cap so if I had to use a guess I would say 50v or so..	human
6112	Some people have issues with it, but any D20 system is good for a beginner.  Be it D&amp;D, star wars or one of the many others.	human
6113	Isn't this kind of creepy that you as a random stranger are trying to hook her up with yet another random stranger.. without even bringing her into the loop?	human
6114	Ahh well my misunderstanding then.  Well I wish you a much more awesome boyfriend from your quest.	human
6115	Well you know, you're doing it in good spirit and she is participating in it.  But serious kudos to you for trying to help out a person who had a tough break.	human
6116	Well luckily there is always a need for caregivers and any one with a CNA in most of the country.  I personally think 3000-5000 bucks is more than enough to move to most places.  Just double check things like rental cost of a vehicle to move your stuff, one, maybe two nights in a hotel, rent and how much you spend on food.  That should give you a good idea of what you are doing.  Also if you end up picking Washington I live 8 miles from WSU so I can always give you a perspective on what the area is like.  -edit- also as a side note I like the Pullman/Moscow area.  Small town feel but due to the two universities here it has a bit more to do.	human
6117	"I find that interesting.  I live in a small town but during our Mardi Gras festival I watched a cop trying to do ""crowd control"" end up getting cold cocked by a drunk due to his actions.  The police ended up inciting the crowd.   Hell I was having a medical issue at the time, was trying to get to my medical gear and the officer pushed me away and wouldn't let me explain why I was trying to get to my car.  Then the drunk dude and his girlfriend were walking by him, he turned and pushed the girl to the ground and shouted something to the effect of ""you can't go this direction"" then he got cold cocked and the dude ran off with his girl friend.  I ended up getting my medical gear and walking off.  If I had been a little clearer headed I would have tried to press charges of assault since he pushed me before a verbal warning.  But it was like he was looking for a fight, and a lot of the other officers were acting belligerent to a rather docile crowd and ended up inciting a lot of people."	human
6118	I have always been curious to serve on a jury.  But every time I get asked questions either the prosecuting or defending attorney hates the fact that I am highly opinionated with a strong sense of what is right and wrong.  So that is possibly one way to get off of the duty.	human
6119	well no recipes but some cookies I would recommend for the holidays are Shortbread cookies, thumbprint cookies, oatmeal crisp cookies, ginger snaps and molasses cookies.  Oh and of course sugar cookies.	human
6120	Your dad is awesome.	human
6121	It is possible it could also sway peoples opinions of comments one way or the other.  As sad as it is, people can be very shallow on a sub conscious level.	human
6122	How do you feel about people who are non-vegetarian?	human
6123	That is a blanket statement for a lot of variables, some yes, some no.  It is complex and varied.  I could point out examples where female genital mutilation is part of a culture, west hands down beats that in my opinion.  Then I could point out how some cultures like in India recognize more than two genders versus the wests bipolar view of gender.	human
6124	hah fair enough, it sucks when any one with a different view tries to stick it down your throat.  I am curious though why do you believe the world would be better if every one ate the way you did?	human
6125	Psh.. it isn't like Africa, Asia or South America ever have conflict due to recourses, religion, different ethnicities or for what seems like no damned good reason..	human
6126	ok.. since you appear to want to continue this argument.. What about China and Japan during WW2, Hutu's and Tutsi's in Africa, Tribal conflicts in South America, Shaka Zulu's treatment of other tribes in Africa and the Dirty War in Argentina to name a few.  I am not sure where Irak is, so I cant really refute that one... Also India is a great place to look for slavery in bonded laborers.  -Edit- Oh and to touch on the famine point.  Look into the modern history of Somolia.	human
6127	According to many yes.  There is not even 2 sexes.  There are hermaphrodites as well who are both male and female.  But as far as gender is concerned that is something that is perceived by the individual.  But in the example of India they recognize males who want to have a more feminine role in society as another gender.  But in the west there is male and female, and if your sex is male your gender damned well better be male too.  -edit-  Wiki has an alright article on gender http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender	human
6128	Having been in some serious down spots in my life I can offer some advice that at least worked for me.  If you are in a large city this will be easier.  Keep looking for a job, if you have been terminated you may not get something in a great pay range for an EE, but it is a start.  Not sure what you are getting fired for so I cant really offer advice there.  Force yourself to eat, go to work, make an effort to always point out a positive side to things.  Something I found is that when feeling negative I always see more negative in things.  By forcing yourself to even acknowledge a small upside to something and keep moving you can possibly change your views.  Once you get moving in a more positive direction it can make a huge change.  Also go out and be with people.  If you have friends hang out with them, if you are short on friends make an effort to meet more people.  Also there are support groups that could help.	human
6129	.... that is a bit twisted.  While I have killed things before, I find the concept of inflicting pain repulsive.	human
6130	"Call me cynical but there usually isn't a ""right"" answer to a question like that.  The way I would see it is she is either trying to see how you feel, or is looking for self validation.  I would just try to be positive, maybe just brush it off like ""That is just silly"" or something to that effect.  Though that could shoot a persons self esteem down more.  You know her so really you are the best judge."	human
6131	This looks like a way better way to observing them versus the shining a spotlight on them at night then running at them with a net just to get a radio tracker on them so you can hopefully follow them.	human
6132	Maybe it is the excess of ramen in my pantry.. but that looks tasty..	human
6133	Probably each person is either lazy and does not check, or they want a chunk of karma thinking their headline/source is better.	human
6134	If it was frozen that whole time then I would not worry about any kind of illness from it.  It may have a slightly off flavor so I would recommend making tacos like eggofknowledge mentioned, spaghetti, shepherds pie or something else that will season it and hide some slight off flavor.	human
6135	I find your views quite interesting.  I personally wouldn't go vegetarian but I make a large effort to not eat to much meat because we were not meant for a heavy meat diet.  As far as hunger I wouldn't say it is complicated.  An acre of wheat can feed more people than the amount of beef that can be supported by an acre.  I remember in a class discussing India and their food growth and farming years ago.	human
6136	While I am fine with a lot of vegetarian food, I also like meat and I am some what selfish.  I also truly enjoy hunting and fishing.  While I seldom shoot anything and mostly end up hiking around the woods with a gun, it is still a sport I enjoy.  Though I completely agree with more efficient food production	human
6137	hah true a hunter could be a vegetarian, but I won't shoot what I won't eat.  Other wise it is a waste.	human
6138	they make camping plastic silverware that is made from lexan.  A lot of sporting good stores have them.	human
6139	It does influence things.  Mainly idiots or the ignorant.	human
6140	As a hunter, who also happens to own an AK.  I have to say that is not a fucking hunting rifle!  I am in shock.	human
6141	Something that my scout master would do is tell you that your coat is unzipped and you need to zip it up.  If you were at all hypothermic you would look for the zipper at the bottom of your coat confused as to where the fuck it was, not realizing that your coat is zipped up.  The confusion that also sets in is a bit unnerving when you look back on it.	human
6142	Glad I could help!	human
6143	I got some kind of punk rocker like jacket.  It was denim with some spikes, tattered and it had a fake hoodie built into it so it looked like you had a hoodie on under the jacket..  Now I tend to wear button up shirts, slacks or khakis, rarely did I even wear jeans at that time.  I have no idea why he thought I would want that.  I thought it was awesome he got me something he was proud of, but it just struck me as strange.	human
6144	One possible factor is that flavors are more apparent when something is heated.  the receptors on the tongue pick things up better when warm.  Then there is also fats are more liquidy so it is less effort to chew meat and a bunch of other factors that could all be taken into consideration.	human
6145	You do not get some one to like you.  They like you for who you are.  But here is the thing, it is THEIR choice, not yours.	human
6146	Could be water you exhale during the night.  A gallon weighs around 8 pounds, so half a pound would be about a 1/16 of a gallon.  Not sure if that is a reasonable amount of exhaled water though for the time you spend sleeping.	human
6147	And she says how it has made her life hell.. yet you are smiling about it.	human
6148	Thanks for actually doing a little bit of research.  Didn't have time when I posted earlier.	human
6149	Also if a friend is also an admin or a submitter, then the name only shows up one color.	human
6150	That is.. brilliant.  It is sort of like Kobe Beef.	human
6151	The good quality ones I have found run around 80-120 for the vast majority of your starting equipment.  Brewcraft makes some great kits.  It also depends on what kind of equipment you are looking for that makes the price vary a lot.	human
6152	You know, I am unsure what problem my M-16 had.. but glad you solved it..	human
6153	Oh yes, just did a brewing demo.  We had the Mr. Beer, Beer Machine and of course the good old way with carboys, primary fermenters and the like.  Of the instant beer type machines, the Beer Machine is the only one that doesn't look terrible, the Mr. Beer is a terrible thing after just handling it.. but still wouldn't go that route.	human
6154	Yea the only advantage I could see to the Beer Machine is if you wanted to half ass brew without any real effort.  Since the main container is also your carbonation chamber and you just add water.  But for me it would take all the fun out of it.  Though as a side note I had to brew soda for the demo since they wouldn't let me hand out beer or wine...  I think that it just added another hobby to my list.	human
6155	Banned with a 2x4 upside the head..	human
6156	Nice, did root beer my first time around.  Debating on cream soda, lemon lime or spruce beer for my next one.	human
6157	jesus.. I do not know what I would do if I saw that.	human
6158	yup, ice 1-15 all exist.  Kind of neat stuff.	human
6159	I second this.	human
6160	1. Not really a damned thing, it was an add on to what I was hired to do.  2. I got my current job because they were looking for some one to work in advertising and the company I work at looks for talent in store first.  I knew how to use photoshop and learned things fast enough to impress them.  On top of advertising I then became the web designer.  Though that is really in title, I am not so great at it.  3. I use wordpress and deal with HTML and PHP.  Done a little bit of stuff with XML but never had a need to implement it.  4. 20Kish  5. Inland Pacific North West.  6. I am two steps underneath the owner.  But my office is under the stairs(literally) going up to the office.. so while only two steps below the top in hierarchy, they are huge steps.	human
6161	in my opinion it is a bit low for what I do, even in my area.  However it isn't terrible I suppose either for the area.	human
6162	Call me old fashioned, but I think a semi-auto hunting weapon takes a great deal of the sport out of it. I have already seen and heard of people taking shots that they were not comfortable with because they have the ability for fast follow up.	human
6163	I have a few moments that are pretty close.. When my mother lost her mental faculties and had to be institutionalized for the first time and best friend committing suicide are probably the two top contenders.	human
6164	Thanks you.  They do not affect me to much any more.  Had a lot of bad, but it also helps me look at the good in things.  I think it really did help me eventually get a better outlook on life.	human
6165	Reddit has been depressing the hell out of me last few days.  That is horrid any one would do that to a cat or any other living creature.  Very glad it is alive and only a busted tail, also dang cute.  	human
6166	I do not believe it, but my favorite one in the 90's was porn.  That the government must release porn for free on the internet.  All it would accomplish is taking some of the naturally computer savvy from that time and distract them with boobies.  There by eliminating a threat by distracting those with the best form of communication.	human
6167	oh yea, it sucks hard.  I think it was probably the roughest few years of my life for even years to come.  I was 14 when it all happened and life just went to hell.  I am glad your mother called the help line.  I hope things are going better for her now.	human
6168	I always toss it into the fridge when I think it is getting close to mold.  Then I just have a french toast extravaganza that coming weekend.	human
6169	For a small fee I will even confirm that I believe your piece of paper to be legitimate.	human
6170	So quick question.  At the beginning of relationships do you tell your boyfriend that you do not believe a monogamous relationship is possible?  Because if you do, I think you are in the clear.  If you do not, then you are selfish and lack self control. Yes, shit happens.  I completely agree with that.  But ultimately self control and respect for the other person is what it takes to at least not cheat, or be upfront about your views.  Do you understand how crushing it is to some ones soul to be cheated on?  I am glad that things are going well with your new guy, but at least be honest with your stances on relationships.	human
6171	Hell I think you can consider a person a boyfriend/girlfriend even without exclusive relationships.  But you are very correct that the title implies an exclusive relationship.  Honesty is the best policy.	human
6172	Something I have found is English muffins freeze and thaw well.  Usually have a few packs in the freezer.	human
6173	I used to make a couple dozen waffles and freeze them.. why I haven't done that lately I know do not know..	human
6174	I really wish more companies had removable waffle griddles in their waffle makers.	human

6177	I am guessing.. but they look like seed eaters.  Finches maybe?  I do not remember her name but there is a redditor that commonly is in the science subreddit that was superb at ID'ing birds.	human
6178	Haven't had much chance to prototype anything.  I prototype with wood, also have a cardboard method.  I take cardboard and smear epoxy over one side, let it dry.  Then smear epoxy on the other side and let it dry.  Easy to cut to shape, relatively cheap, and a bit tougher than balsa wood.	human
6179	white phosphorous suspended in red oil?  The oil keeps it from reacting, but when ruptured the white phosphorous auto ignites with air, then igniting the oil...?	human
6180	Most memorable thing I can recall commuting from work happened years ago.  I was heading home after I had closed down the store I worked at.  It is late and there is no one on the freeway as I am driving home.  There is this drunk dude in front of me swerving a full 4 lanes back and forth.  Well I don't want to pass him, so I just follow going about 25 miles an hour.  Well a few cars pull up next to me, I have one behind me, one on the left and one on the right.  All three were cops and they all hit their lights and sirens at the same time.  If I was an old man I would have died of a heart attack.  So I just keep going in a straight line since I can't pull over and then they all race around me and the drunk punches it down the freeway.	human
6181	in case they need to light something on fire?  Maybe they manufacture incendiary rounds/grenades?  I don't know.  Could be the video game community things base commanders are eccentric and crazy.	human
6182	actually it didn't end like that.  He floored it for maybe 500 yards, then pulled over.  Ended up passing the whole group very shortly after it began.	human
6183	oh dear.  going to show my nerdy side.  Warp 2 is twice as fast as warp 1, warp 3 is twice as fast as warp 2.  At least that is how it used to be.	human
6184	So.. you show up to a church where they believe you are an atheist?	human
6185	Not sure what you mean by it came out worse.  That alone could mean several dozen things.  But things I do with my glass carboys is fill it relatively full.  Only leave a few inches of air space at the top.  This cuts down on the rate of oxidization.  I also keep them in the dark to cut down on light oxidation.  However if you fill your carboy pretty dang full, you either need a spill off tube or do your primary fermentation in something else.  	human
6186	I do not remember, got given a bunch of epoxy years ago.  It might not be cost effective if you dont have some already.	human
6187	From doing wine I can tell you at least the most common method to stop secondary fermentation from happening in the bottle.  You kill off the yeast using a sulphur compound like cambden tablets.  Then you add a yest inhibitor like potassium sorbate.  The potassium sorbate stops new yeast from fermenting, but will not stop yeast that has been established.  That is why you need to kill it with the cambden tablets.  Though if you just wait till the gravity is constant it likely shouldn't be an issue like airekpublius said.  Also your uncle is lucky to have you as a nephew.  -edit-  Oh! and if you do decide to go the preserving route, give it a rest period between adding the preservatives and bottling.  The cambden tablets add a sulphur flavor that some people can pick up, but it offgasses.  So give it a few days for it to offgas.	human
6188	Because we love double standards almost as much as we love labels.	human
6189	well.. that too.	human
6190	It sounds like it was a cheap firearm and you did your friend a favor by test firing it.  But it is ALWAYS foolish to put too hot or an incorrect caliber into a firearm.	human
6191	Very nice!  I love the style.	human
6192	Yes, but is it an incorrect round for the firearm?  Also if it is an incorrect round for the firearm do they hand fire it? or do they put it in something to hold it and remotely pull the trigger?  I personally do not thing that a .22lr should blow apart any functioning .22l but as a matter of principle it is ALWAYS a bad idea to not stay withing the designed tolerances of a firearm.  It is tantamount to going rock climbing weighing 50Lbs more than the rope is rated for.  Honestly it will probably be ok if it is a small enough percentile change.  But serious harm to you and your life can occur.	human
6193	BBC or NPR for me.	human
6194	I had one situation where people drew knives.  I was with a co-worker and had to deal with guilt by association.  Drew my pocket knife and nothing but words were tossed back and forth.  For me being good at talking in person and having a knife(that also sounds intimidating when it opens) helped me out.  You know, I have lived an interesting life.	human
6195	I am strapped for cash right now I would donate.  So sadly best I can give you is I wish your mother best of luck.	human
6196	"Uhh.. just ignore him.  By responding with something ""clever"" you validate him some one important enough to acknowledge and respond to.  Also how did he get the facebook info?"	human
6197	fair enough.	human
6198	I know, but was about the best I could come up with..	human
6199	Sadly it sounds like the tiny bit the judge threw out also helped to sway the jury.	human
6200	Well it LOOKS awful, but it is pretty tasty.  Also great if you got some frozen mixed veggies or something to toss in.	human
6201	As a right handed, left eye dominant person I do not think so.  I have always been pretty handy with a rifle.  Left handed is far more awkward at least for me than shooting right eyed.	human
6202	Sparkfun.com has some good 8 pin boards that are pretty inexpensive.	human
6203	I may have missed it on your site, but what did you use for the brains of your robot?	human
6204	Nice, looks like it uses an atmel.  Great MCU's.  Looks like a pretty nice board.  I ended up building my own board for home tinkering with robotics.  Any recomendations for any one getting into robotics?	human
6205	Well thank you!  While I did build the board the functionality of it is pretty basic.  I am using an ATMEGA328 as the MCU for it.  On the IO pins I ended up hooking 3 male headers to, one for the IO, then the other two for ground and source.  That way I can hook sensors, motor controlls or whatever else I want to the IO pin and it hooks the item to the power rails.  It can communicate through serial for debugging and programs through a parallel port.  My main issue is I know hardware pretty well, but the software is near magic to me.  I have not done anything recently.  Had a rocky spot and had to move out and get a new place, kind of threw my tinkering off to the side.  Picking it up again.  I am debating on working with the board I build, or making a simple mouse bot that just avoids obsticals using IR as a proximity sensor.  I think it would just be neat to have a smallest possible robot.  Last thing I worked on that I posted any info on was this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR5NfH8WW7w Not a robot, but my first real attempt at using a MCU, and still pretty new at it.  As far as not studying EE that makes two of us.  It is just a fun hobby.	human
6206	"Sorry for commenting twice, sent this to your wrong comment.. That is a self post.  I would personally toss in the info from your ""I built the robot for 6.270, our Autonomou..."" comment."	human
6207	Why would you dress in animal skins when you damned well know people are out to shoot at animals?	human
6208	This used to be a lot more common, but you can never go wrong with frozen junior mints.  But if you want something unique to most of america you could have a red bean ice cream for the ice cream cones.  Also dried fruit like banana chips or something would be different.	human
6209	Well about a year ago I had this crazy old lady as a neighbor.  Other than her crazy delusions not actually a bad neighbor, very quite.  I am sitting in my living room and I hear a knock on the door.  I get up and it is a police officer with a bemused look on his face.  He tells me that he technically has to talk to me.  My neighbor apparently decided that myself, and the other two neighbors around here were conspiring to kill her and we wanted to rent her entire apartment for drug storage.  the officer just told me that with a potential death threat he has to talk to all the parties but not to worry about it.  The girls in my apartment before me were running a brothel and the people before them were hitmen according to the old lady.  We joked for a bit and the officer went on his way.  All the dirty looks the old lady had given me made sense finally.	human
6210	sad thing is, I bet it would be tasty.	human
6211	Physical pain? when I was in junior high I got beat up enough that I had a fractured wrist and a few bruised ribs.  Emotional pain would have been watching my mothers sanity slip away, becoming diabetic, or the guilt of thinking the stress of me being diabetic was the straw that broke the camels back making my mother lose her marbles.	human
6212	I bet it is like the poultry cousin to bacon.	human
6213	See I have sympathy for some sport hunters.  However the parties involved in this do not get any from me.  It is one thing in my mind when a hunter in hunters safety orange gets shot, it is another when a guy in pelts gets shot.	human
6214	Oh yes, damned good cheese.  Glad I live just a short drive from their creamery.	human
6215	A one night stand, and you didn't wear a rubber?  No offence but that is pretty dumb.  Also pulling out is not a viable means stopping pregnancy.  You are likely safe from her if this story is real, and not a troll.  But hopefully this scared some sense into you.  Also STD's can kill you..	human
6216	I may be wrong.  But I do not believe that you can legally force some one to have an abortion.	human
6217	In a situation like this, the dude hasn't much choice.  He could for custody or get himself removed from any legal responsibility for the child.	human
6218	you know what.  Since some one.. who probably caught a STD has been downvoting every sensible person.. Upvotes all around!	human
6219	Well depends on the animal.  But there are various tactics.  One used commonly against antelope is a blind, also used against ducks.  Basically it is just a tent with some gun slots in it.  Camo us used during archery season.  but you have to get up close and personal for a bow, so it is pretty safe.	human
6220	hmm that is an animal I have never hunted.  Though I would love to one of these days.  Will have to look into tactics for that.	human
6221	Why thank you!  The really sad thing is if he is concerned about his karma/rep to the point of deleting this stuff.  The likely hood of him being a troll goes down..	human
6222	Though I propose that the zipper should be facing the inside, rather than the outside.	human
6223	Frankly I will be very glad.  I have no issues with any of the people in the ads, they are just getting old.  Though I also am not a fan of the picture settings and poses.	human
6224	My boss would kill me if I had photos for an ad that looked like that.  I also dislike how they tried to emphasize the uniqueness of reddit.  To me it is over the top, and poorly shot like you say.	human
6225	it is safe for work.	human
6226	I just love my background pic I made.. But my coworkers computers have definitely found a new background!	human
6227	Surprises are always better.	human
6228	Man that is great.  I regret not being able to take part in the awesomeness that was the Secret Santa project.	human
6229	They change color, but they usually look hazel.	human
6230	That would be good, especially if I had a webcam to record their face...  Last time I messed with a coworkers computer I took a screenshot and made their desktop image their new desktop.  Had the start bar go to auto hide and watched them try to figure it out for a good minute before they asked me what I did &gt;.&gt;	human
6231	The cat of an ex loved my hypodermic needles for some reason.  She would pick them up and carry them around.	human
6232	Alright, if you are his friend you should ask yourself a question.  Is he happy with her?  If he is, then why are you against it?  It is him that is with her, and it is him that is happy with her.  Not you.  Now if he is unhappy with her, rationally bring it up in a conversation.  Now realize.  You can not stop him, short of something dramatically stupid on your part.  It is his choice, not yours.	human
6233	I can feel for you.  Best advice I can give is this.  If he knows how you feel, just be his friend and catch him when/if he falls.	human
6234	Maybe together we could offer expertise!  I mainly do digital touch up of photo shoots you do photography.  I do not know about you, but I would definitely donate my time for a good cause.	human
6235	Except for during a stop nearly none of these signs would be applicable.	human
6236	::sigh:: that is a shame.  Maybe something that could be pushed is having the staff basically apply to reddit showing their work..  I just feel like it wouldn't be hard to do better than a lot of these shots.  Or at least touch up bad shots in photoshop.  Lighting and a few other things can be improved a bit.  -edit-  Though I guess it is very easy to be an armchair critic too.	human
6237	True, but I still stand by my statement.  The signs they use while potentially useful to know, aren't that great for overall use due to limitations of accuracy and the like.  Though I suppose where you are would come into play.  I come at this from a perspective where carrying is common and crime is petty at best in town.  I guess in a larger city with more crime it could be more relevant.	human
6238	Wow... That is creepy.	human
6239	maybe it is a research project by marketing students...?  I always wonder how much though people like that make in marketing.	human
6240	"Great,  now for the next day I am going to see posts of ""No, THIS is a serious fuel carrier!"""	human
6241	What did you use to fry the component?  Also did you test to see what the max range is? I am guessing only a few inches, but would still be neat to know.	human
6242	"Reminds me of those stroke commercials.  ""You wouldn't ignore this symptom would you?(guy ordering food with an arrow in his chest)"".  Tough guy though."	human
6243	Did you forget a link?	human
6244	Naw, it is early and my built in spam filter is still in bed.. Though maybe it could be a game of questions.	human
6245	But, what would a clerk do?  Kick any one out he suspects of packing?  I suppose they could prepare themselves for the worst  But as an employee who has no power at a 7-11 at 2am they would be limited.  Also if the person planned on robbing the place, preemptively telling them to leave the store probably would do nothing but make the person pull the gun sooner.	human
6246	It is all good.  We were all new once.  You could delete and resubmit, or edit the text into your current post.	human
6247	Not going to work to spread my cold.	human
6248	Oh good, I was hoping some one would bring up the bog butter.  Bogs are great at preserving stuff.	human
6249	I do not think that a driver is an athlete, but I can see it as a sport.  There are many sports that involve skill over athletic skill.  What of shooting, archery, pool, poker and many others.	human
6250	"Actually almost any component is measured in current/time.  Also known as Amp/Hours.  So a 2,500mAh 1.5v battery can supply 2.5 amps at 1.5 volts for one hour before it is dead.  Parts like a MCU like an ATMEGA328 will consume .2mA in full running mode and an LED could consume something like 20mA.  So using two 2,500mAh 1.5V batteries in series to raise the voltage to 3.0 Volts you could roughly run those two components for a little over 123 hours in a perfect calculation.  There are variables that you would also have to calculate to get a really accurate estimate, but it just takes a little time.  While things like the lights running would draw current, you could roughly estimate the amount of ""shots"" the gun had before it died.  You could then use a microcontroller with an LED display to count down the number of trigger pulls.  -edit-  got a cold so my head is a bit foggy, had to fix a part."	human
6251	::sigh:: yea I am just not going to talk about electronics any more with a fever.  reread the whole thing and I understand it less now than I did when I posted.  Misunderstood your question to start with :P	human
6252	Ahh.. is she a bad cook or something?  I would be stoked if some one cooked me dinner.	human
6253	I do not know about Georgia, but some states do not seem to care.  Like Idaho, it is illegal to use any non-native ingredient.  But it is not illegal to sell or buy brewing supplies that are non-native, just can't brew with them.	human
6254	chocolate or cash.	human
6255	Absolutely right.  Making empty threats just shows that you are not in charge.  If they still get what they want when acting bad, then there is nothing to show they need to improve their behavior.	human
6256	naw, 'definitely' would be wrong.  They could die in a car wreck tomorrow for instance.  Nothing in life is for sure.	human
6257	This time of year it is split pea.	human
6258	Maybe the occasional 'Thank you' after a question is answered and goes well.	human
6259	The entire office where I work had to come in.	human
6260	A nice card and $20 that was stashed inside of it.  That was this year.  Most favorite ever?  I honestly do not have one that I can think of right now that sticks out above any other.	human
6261	When was it you first realized that those were the fields for you?  What was that moment?  Also do you love the field you work in?	human
6262	Well Christmas aside, I usually resent the fact I am at work.  I always wanted to work as a lottery winner.  Warm beaches, tropical islands, private yacht and all that other good stuff.	human
6263	Pumpkin pie with real whip cream, gobs of it.	human
6264	Cool Whip!? Where is the look of disapproval when you need him..	human
6265	It definitely will not do your credit any favors.	human
6266	What if you live in a small town?  I would like to use a credit union but the local one doesn't even have a master card or visa debit card.  So I can't buy anything at most major stores with it.	human
6267	If killing them is not a plausible solution you are some what screwed.  Best I can recommend is that if the noise comes through the window add another layer of some type.  Like a sheet of plastic stapled over the frame like you would do to insulate in a cold winter.  Another option might be big fluffy curtains.  They could potentially dampen the sound a bit.	human
6268	Oh another idea then is a fan.  White noise could potentially drown out some of the noise, and cause a breeze.  -edit- if you are a light sleeper the fan will bother you too, but a constant non changing noise is easier to adapt to.	human
6269	hmm if you have a computer in the room you could likely download some white noise mp3's.  Could work till you get a fan maybe?	human
6270	Damned this sucks.  Have you tried something like disposable shooting ear muffs?  http://elitefirearmsandtacticalsupply.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=927&amp;currency=USD here is a link to some.  They are basically a soft foam rubber that you crunch up and shove into the ear, then they expand.  They feel a bit weird so they may be worse than the noise.	human
6271	Hah yea, I didn't even think about the alarm...  Well if you are savvy with electronics I would recommend a blinking light.  If you have something like a strobe light go off it will wake most people.  Also I bet you may be able to find alarm clocks for the deaf online.  -edit- here is one for 20 bucks, though probably would be a moot point after the wait for shipping if you are moving soon http://www.activeforever.com/p-1704-shake-awake-vibrating-alarm-clock.aspx?CMPID=Froogle_shake-awake-vibrating-alarm-clock	human
6272	Cop does something wrong and gets punished, then becomes whiny bitch about..  Have to at least give the department some props for suspending him and possibly firing him since he is now a former police officer.	human
6273	It's fun to be judgmental!	human
6274	I do not have the gear for artificial carbonation, but I know a guy who does.  He leaves it under pressure for a few days and shakes the keg once in the morning and once at night.  That is probably a bit of overkill, but I think that 10-15 minutes is probably low balling how long you need to leave it under pressure.  Also just shaking the keg for that long you are either going to have massive arms, or a hernia.  Also you should try making home made soda some time!  Also kind of a neat home project to do if you have kids.  You can get extracts at a lot of brewing places.	human
6275	It could be a power surge that took it out.  There are a lot of reasons that only two things died if it was indeed a power surge.  It could be that the furnace and fridge were both running at the time of the surge while other appliances were not.  The components in the fridge and furnace could have been closer to the end of their life also.  Could also be due to the design of the circuits.  There are ways to make something more resistant to surges.  Any damage could also be invisible to you.  A surge can stress a component out shortening its life.  It could be now the TV may not live as long.  Likely it is a mix of many variables why some died, some did not.	human

6277	I got a question for you.  Are you as big of a selfish jerk in real life as you come across in this post?  It sounds like you are here just trying to flaunt your 'awesome' bitter nature while insulting 'friends' to me.	human
6278	Hmm I love licorice, kimchi and anything spicy enough to make your nose run like a faucet.	human
6279	http://www.Digikey.com and http://www.Sparkfun.com are my standard for a lot of discrete components.  I have heard http://www.goldmine-elec.com/ is good, but never used them.  However I do use radioshack at times, they kind of suck in most areas but they have nice bundles of resistors and a few other things that I consider worth while to get since I don't have to wait for shipping.	human
6280	Blinker soul mates are rare.  It is a true gift if you can find yours.	human
6281	Hell it was in the early 90's for me.  Best friend committed suicide the day after Christmas when I was 12.  It was what started me on the whole bah humbug path.	human
6282	That and I would bet you can't make a perfect monochromatic light.  -edit-  at least in that sense.  You could make a light be monochromatic by just having one frequency of light.  But single frequency of light are what we do perceive as color.  To be white light it needs to have many colors in it, that is what gives selectively reflective materials their color.	human
6283	Living about 5 hours from an apple store, I can assure you it still isn't really funny.  Mildly amusing at best.	human
6284	I am pretty sure with some creative thinking you can use a 555 timer and do it better than me.  But what I have I would just use a microcontroller, some kind of piezzo buzzer, voltage regulator and an led as the circuit.  But I also have a box of microcontrollers..  If you went that route you would need some basic programming skill, and something tiny and basic like an ATTINY13.  Now if you wanted the beeping to be more exact you may want a microcontroller and a speaker to make the tone you want.  Since the beeping picks up pace I am not fluent enough with electronics to come up with another answer off the top of my head.  -edit-  Also if you have an LED for the blinky, you will want a diffused LED.  Or you can take a non-diffused LED and scuff it up with a fine grit sand paper.	human
6285	Oh if you have some experience I would say a micro is the way to go.  A little bit of C would do it.  Also something like an atmel has a lot of neat built in features.  They can do pulse width modulation and they have an internal resistor/capacitor oscillator as a source clock.  You could run the beeping with the PWM to generate a tone, then the LED could be driven off of one of the I/O pins directly.  You would just need a switch to start it and a power supply.  Hell I wouldn't even hook the switch up to an I/O port.  Just have the unit start the process when powered up and have the switch control the power.  An increase in the rate of beeping/blinking could also be ran off of the source clock and software driven.	human
6286	oh yes, good points.  I always forget that since I have all that gear.	human
6287	I think that is a shirt.	human
6288	Hmm biscuits and gravy with eggs over easy resting on golden brown hash browns and a bunch of bacon on the side.	human
6289	America.  I forget that what we call biscuits is different than most the English speaking world.  Here is a recipe if your curious. http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,184,137165-239204,00.html	human
6290	"My favorites are the ""So, I had unprotected sex with a stranger.  Should I worry?"""	human
6291	Order.  It is like a disease for me.  If I see something I consider wrong or out of order,  if some one doesn't fix it I will just be bothered by the fact it is out of whack and have to fix it myself.	human
6292	Well I would say it depends.  Depending on the nation, clean drinking laws require contaminants to be below a certain level that can affect a person.  Something most homeopath specialists actually have some skill at.	human
6293	I would definitely recommend trying it for breakfast if you get the chance.  It is one of those heart attack on a plate foods that your life can't be complete until you have it.  Though it will shorten that now complete life..	human
6294	Well for me I found having something I can see results with helped me learn what I have so far.  I took up working with embedded systems and needed to learn C for that.  It is kind of neat to build something that physically moves or reacts to stimulus.  For me it has a better feel than something happening on screen.	human
6295	It would be more efficient to use in the barrel.  The barrel directs the force in one directions.  In mid air the force will go in every direction, as well as botch your possible accuracy.	human
6296	Peanut butter in a trap will work wonders.  Another thing you could do is get a clear glass, and cut the packing tape with the glass in front of it.  If you have speedy cat like reflexes(mice are damned fast) you might be able catch it by hand in the glass if it tries to run through it.	human
6297	Oh I wouldn't put the peanut butter in a glass.  The thing with the glass is the mouse would think it was an escape path, so it would run into it and if you were fast enough you could tip up the glass and block it off with something like a book.  As far as bait the mouse is probably to terrified with the prodding to go straight for food.  However in a trap peanut butter is the best bait.	human
6298	Yea, most animals will not risk their life for food unless they are very starved.  If you try the cup idea versus leaving a trap alone tell me how it works out.  If it escapes also leave some traps about.	human
6299	Any idea what you want to do specifically with embedded systems?  You can get almost everything you need to start for near 30 bucks if you know what you are after.  If you know what you want I could point you in a direction to start.  I love talking about this stuff.	human
6300	Like ColdWar pointed out the Unitarian Universalists are a great church.  Depending on the region usually Episcopalian churches are very open and similar to the Unitarians.	human
6301	"Damned that sucks how you lost your ""best"" friend and ex.  Sucks at whatever age you are,  don't let people tell you it is fine since you're young.  My advice though is not to run away.  I have had some bad shit happen when I was close to that age, and I can give you the advice I wish I had.  Life gets a lot tougher when you are supporting yourself.  Would your family let you get a part time job, join a club, get a hobby that would get you out of the house?  As silly as it seems even something like a ballroom dancing club would be great.  You would hang out with people and be away from the things bothering you.  Your club choices are likely limited at a christian school, but there are also groups out there for kids and if you live in a larger city they may be an option."	human
6302	Well http://www.societyofrobots.com has a $50 robot plan.  Though this assumes you have some supplies like soldering iron.  An Arduino or Olimex board are good starters.  Depending on the model there are a few things you need with them. Here is an Olimex for 28pin AVR MCU's http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=29 and here is an Arduino you can program with a USB port and here is an Arduino board http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=666  Both of these need a power supply that runs around 5 bucks or so usually, and the Olimex you need a dongle to program and it is around 12 bucks.  Do you have a budget you can spend? or is money just to tight right now to tinker?	human
6303	That is always a terrible feeling.  Been there at times where ten bucks was well beyond what I had to spend.  Hope all goes well in your robotic endeavors when you start.	human
6304	No question really.  Just glad you are on your meds and it works well for you.  I have a second cousin who has nympholepsy and it seems like life can be pretty normal if you take care of yourself.	human
6305	Thanks!  Good call mentioning the free day.  I almost forgot about that.	human
6306	I believe if corn sugar is higher in fructose, then it is sweeter.  But yeast can break down the corn sugar easier so there is likely to be less residual sugar after the fermentation.	human
6307	Problem is whatever gets the rust off, you have a high chance of ruining the decal.  Flitz metal polish would take care of the rust, but remove any design potentially.  Another option would be to use electricity.  http://www.instructables.com/id/Electrolytic-Rust-Removal-aka-Magic/ never actually used this, but in principle it is sound.  The electricity is likely the best option for not removing the decal, but it will probably leave some visible blemishes where the rust was.	human
6308	hmm.. never used brasso so no idea..	human
6309	It could be friction at one of the moving points is causing it to vibrate.  The vibration could be what is generating the tone.  This is maybe why the tone is higher when the rotational speed isn't so high.	human
6310	Could also be a single part like a bearing internally that could be doing it, rather than the whole unit.  I am not sure if you could see much on something spinning that fast.	human
6311	Don't bring a knife to a gunfight..	human
6312	Well would be neat if you really are the voice actress.  But you should get this post confirmed with a moderator.  No one will take it seriously until you do.  It may also just get deleted by a mod.	human
6313	Can't answer for sure. But I bet the flavor degrades over time.  Oxidization will occur and flavors will be altered.  As far as going bad, no idea.  It is likely salty and acidic.  Both things are against mold and bacteria growth.	human
6314	I have very little respect for the religion.  However a lot of its members are perfectly fine.  Also you can not change another person, and should not try it.  If your lack of faith disturbs her, that is her problem not yours.  I hate to be a dick, but this relationship sounds doomed.  If you join the religion to be with her, then you haven't joined it due to personal belief.  Basically you will be living a lie to be with some one.  Typically relationships built on lies fail quickly.	human
6315	Always wear clean underwear.	human
6316	Looks like if you get a diode they are a hell of a lot cheaper.  It would likely just leave a glowing streak where the beam touches.  The light coming out of the laser is no different than the UV light coming out of a LED as far as the material is concerned.	human

6319	Do you find things like dancing a little more challenging with an average hight guy?	human
6320	Would have to be in excellent shape for me to consider that price.  The price seems a bit steep, but I haven't priced guns for years.  That being said I enjoy shooting them.  I had a friend with a k98 and I fell in love with the rifle for various reasons.	human

6322	Hah I am having a boring day at work myself.  Trying to figure out what to build as a project.. But any more I do not try to correct many people when they are saying something I think is wrong.  Seeing an error is like having bamboo shoved under my nails.  Arguing with people who refuse to see another view point is like having bamboo shoved under my nails and hot sauce poured in my eyes..	human
6323	Ok.  Any idea why it is worse for you? or is it just a worse flavor?	human
6324	thank you, upvote for concern of others.  But I have smoked marijuana once in my life, and was thoroughly unimpressed.  This is just likely to be a once in a blue moon vice any ways.	human
6325	Being diabetic I have an ample supply of 31ga ultra-fine hypodermics that may see a second use in life now.	human
6326	Hah, it is so open ended because I am clueless on this.  I have tried smoking my hookah once already with the herbal shisha it came with.  Already noticed a few issues.  Would you recommend poking holes in the foil only under the coals or not under the coals?  As far as small holes I use my insulin needles to poke holes, so really can't get much smaller than that.  Found out though they are so small I need to poke around 60 holes to even be able to take a drag, so I may go with something that makes larger ones like a toothpick.  Thanks for such a in depth answer by the way!	human
6327	Probably sitting home on my computer.	human
6328	Hell, I am here drinking a beer.  Have a conversation with me or another redditor.	human
6329	I have never found him funny.	human
6330	Honestly, neither.  But that is because I do not watch TV hardly ever any more.  Been trying it out, though I think I may have to buy a cable service again one of these days.	human
6331	Could be good to watch.  It is kind of sad but what I miss most is the food network, Good Eats with Alton Brown is great.  Years ago I used to love the history channel and discovery channel, but they turned to crap before I stopped watching much tv.	human
6332	No I haven't seen that.  First I heard of it was a couple of weeks ago from a coworker.  I have been curious.  I wonder if Hulu has it.  Any more the topic of TV is something I am not to well versed in what goes on.	human
6333	That seems like something a bit odd to get into.  How the hell did you get into that?  Any kind of board games you sell in particular? Or is it just board games in general?	human
6334	"Holy shit!  That is a great skill to have, if things go bad you know you can support yourself in a pinch!  Do you do this for a living still, or have a ""normal"" job?  It is always funny how you pick up skills.  As a student I ended up getting as a cashier at a place and managed to get into an advertising position and learned a bunch of photoshop skills.  Now I just need to figure out how to make that kind of money out of it ;)"	human
6335	That is pretty damned slick.  Excellent markup value too.  So what do you do now?	human
6336	Currently working in advertising at a privately owned store in north Idaho.  If I could find the money I would be in school at this moment.  But last semester I was in found out the expensive way that they hardly covered my medical expenses with SHIP after a few changes.  So just saving up to head back into it.  Was doing biological systems engineering.  Though now I think I may go into a stricter science field.  I love doing research.	human
6337	Well my biggest issue is my love of different fields is to broad at the moment.  But if I stick with biology I think microbiology would be pretty cool.	human
6338	There have been times when I have wished I was a bit less curious lol.  I have had nearly every hobby under the sun at one point.  If I could just stay focused I would be a hell of a lot better off.	human
6339	So, if you don't want to answer, feel free not to.  But why are you feeling depressed right now?	human
6340	See.. what I need to do is focus on how to live a lot longer.  More time to do more stuff.	human
6341	I agree.  I wish more people were like redditers.  Though then we would have to deal with even more people obsessed with narwhals, bacon and other memes.  The holidays are always kind of a downer for me, but just hanging out and talking with people on reddit can make a bad day better.	human
6342	I sure do.	human
6343	It is ok, I drink a lot of caffeine too.	human
6344	Ahh I bet you have a few more than that.  I live in a city with 20,000 people and there is at least two here..  Possibly as high as 3-4!	human
6345	Fair enough.  Also helps that it is a college town.	human
6346	I agree that it is very disrespectful.  But Also why call out an age? Do you believe that there are no other ages of douchebags doing this?  I understand you are likely using the age to call them immature, and they are.  But we also have some very young people on reddit, so why don't we show some respect to their age too.  I think just respect in general is something reddit could use a little more of.  I will get off of my soapbox now..  -edit-  Hah! Apparently the downvoters disagree that there needs to be more respect.	human
6347	Sadness, your town can never have enough redditors.  I should try to get a meetup together for here.  See if we can maybe all hang out.  Would be neat to hang with some new people.	human
6348	It is really meaningless in the big scheme of things.  But some people reddit is their group of friends and peers.  If some one is down in the dumps or a bit unsure of themselves it will seem like people disapprove of them as a person.  I am sure more than a couple redditers do not go out that much and are a bit short on irl friends.	human
6349	I guess people know better than to mess with Usul.	human
6350	Naw I think that is cool to do.  You are voting on quality, not out of hate/love of the poster.	human
6351	Hell that game was actually pretty good.  After a decade of sucking, it is great to see UofI finally kicking some ass again.  Sucks they missed it.	human
6352	But to add to this.  I feel if she wants to go for you, Make sure she leaves the other guy first out of general respect for another human.	human
6353	It saddens me so much that Remington has gone into the shitter with quality.  But I will just second that savage is a great brand, definitely great value.  Another brand of optics I have had good luck with besides Burris is the Nikon Prostaffs for quality and price.  Though I have not taken the rifle with my Nikon out that much yet, so will fess up it hasn't been ran through the woods a lot yet.	human
6354	Nothing like growing up in a loveless argument filled household where you often feel alone and at fault!	human
6355	beer and loneliness.	human
6356	Depends on the terrain and the role I would be filling at war.  May seem like a cop out answer but they both have their place.  Overall though I prefer the ability to carry more ammo and the higher accuracy of the M-16.	human
6357	... Really?  I own both rifles and appreciate them both.  But a single grain of sand can foul up an action on a M-16.  An AK is far more resilient against pretty much everything.  In a desert like environment unless I am dealing with very long range shots(as far as average combat ranges is concerned) then I would rather have the AK.	human
6358	Yeesh.. why do your answers have to be so flip floppy? ;)	human
6359	You know.. if you are going to come up with some kind of thing to fuck with people?  Make at least partially believable.	human
6360	"The thought repeating through my head would be ""Don't put the pedal to the floor.."""	human
6361	The plot is abysmal if you ask me.  Basically it is just the visually striking immersion.  The movie is pretty much to see breath taking views of people running, jumping, swinging and explosions.  That being said I still did enjoy it.	human
6362	Very cool! pretty much what I did for my first project.  Got a pic of it running?	human
6363	Nice.  How stable is it? Does it fluctuate at all due to line noise? Or does it hold nice and steady?	human
6364	Very cool.  Very glad it worked out for you.	human
6365	This is likely an automated letter that is sent out whenever there is any kind of balance issue.  Also it is your money, not theirs.  It doesn't matter if it is 1 penny, they will still do this.  There are a few reasons why they would do this, likely most of them are legal reasons.	human
6366	Cats are almost always cute, no matter the size.	human
6367	I really hope he doesn't get elected.  Though Idaho tends to be red to a fault, he would likely have a good amount of people against him.	human
6368	Always keep some sand or kitty litter in your trunk.  The little bit of extra weight never hurts, but if you are stuck the extra traction can save your ass.  Do not drive to fast, always accelerate slowly and break slowly and early.  Also never hurts to keep a blanket in the trunk in case you get stuck some where.  The cold is also killer on a battery so a portable battery jump start is a great thing.	human
6369	Just want to mention one thing.  If you are running the car for warmth when stuck, check your exhaust every so often to make sure it is clear.  In really really bad conditions snow can completely bury the exhaust and will cause carbon monoxide to go into the passenger area.	human

6372	"Sad story, there was a kid at a party that got shot in the face with a 12gauge in my neighborhood.  Some kids were at a party drinking and then one of the kids decided to show off his shotgun.  They did rack it a bunch of times to make sure the tube was clear.  A round had jammed in the tube so it wasn't fed into the action and ejected.  The kid was pointing it at people and pulling the trigger.  Then one of the party goers said something to the effect of ""hey that isn't cool, knock it off that is dangerous"" and so they pointed the gun at him.  That time though it racked the round and hit him point blank in the face with bird shot."	human
6373	Very awesome of you to support people in times of need.  What enticed you to take up that job?	human

6385	"Was in boy scouts.  My cousin who always did stuff that wasn't the sharpest was roof jumping with every one.  The snow outside was around 5-6 feet deep, we were jumping off a second story balcony into it.  Then with some famous last words he yells out to every one ""Hey watch this!"".  As he jumps down instead of sprawling his legs and arms, he tucks his arms by his side and stands completely rigid.  He hits the ground feet first and goes in like a lawn dart to the middle of his chest.  We all had a good laugh out of it because he was unable to even free his arms from the snow.  It took us near 20 minutes to dig enough of him out to free him."	human
6386	Thank you!  I only have a few more background images.  I haven't worked on any for months.  I just haven't felt motivated to do any more.

6393	One thing that I found that helps, always try to find a good of something.  Even if there is more bad than good in your mind.  Make a point to point out the good.  Over time you can change how you perceive things.  This helps with the positive attitude over time.  As far as confidence let me know if you find out a trick for that.	human

6399	You do not really get the emotional aspect of most humans do you..	human
6400	No offence intended, but realizing people are emotional, and understanding that emotion are not the same.  It is an act that to the average person not only does physical harm, but emotional and psychological harm.  Like others said how would you like to be assaulted, injured and then forced to do something completely degrading and humiliating with possible permanent affects to your health let alone your ability to cope with the actions?  Replace rape with anal fisting by an angry biker, and the chick getting raped with yourself.  Would you be able to brush that off with no issue what so ever?  Or would you spend years where the thunderous sound of a Harley filled you with fear?	human
6401	"Personally I would guess that the OP has a disorder where they do not get emotion.  There are some people out there that would be unable to understand where an ""average"" person would come from on certain things.  Kind of like those with Aspergers syndrome and social interaction."	human

Really?  I do not know a single person that thinks this.  This article seems to be a poorly thought out rant..	human
6417	Sure thing dude.  Here is a link http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/	human
6418	Ahh I miss my ferrets..	human
6419	"Yes there would be calories in poop.  Several things though.  Calories do not mean food.  You know gasoline is LOADED with calories.  It is just a scientific unit to measure heat.  1 calorie will raise 1ml of water 1°C.  In food we measure kilocalories.  So a 100 calorie desert actually has 100,000 calories in it.  This being said, we can ""process"" shit into food.  You spread it on the ground with seeds."	human
6420	Good link.  I learned all about that fun stuff in my soils class.  I Find it pretty fascinating.	human
6421	I never find time for my hobbies.  Also finding money for them can be tough.  I am currently working with embedded systems as my one main hobby right now though.  I tend to cycle through hobbies over time because I can't do them all at the same time.  I have done artwork in photoshop, model rocketry,  long range shooting and I keep both fresh and saltwater fishtanks.	human
6422	This article is nothing but propaganda.	human
6423	I think that the h1n1 vaccine was rushed and poorly dealt with.  But the whole contains nervous system disruptors bit without even mentioning what they are is just shoddy at best.  Also the general anti vaccine tone of the article shows the sheer ignorance of the author.  That is what I have the issue with.  Not his ranting against h1n1 specifically.  To me it is very similar to the anti vaccine bullshit that came out due to a poorly designed study linking the MMR vaccine to autism.. despite the fact that it massive amounts of data has come out to the contrary, people still cling to that.  Vaccines are a wonderful thing.  I think that a bit more oversight would be a good thing in certain aspects with vaccines.  But this is just a propaganda article just like what he is trying to point out.	human
6424	Lucky for me I have nearly no social life lol.  A good site if you are trying the whole robotics thing is here http://www.societyofrobots.com/step_by_step_robot.shtml they have a 50 dollar tutorial.  If you want to start a little deeper into nitty gritty parts of the process here is a good tutorial on embedded systems http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=57 It starts with the power supply and moves you through programming.  These two sources are actually how I got started.  The sparkfun tutorial is great because it covers aspects most tutorials do not, like the importance of a filtered power supply.	human
6425	This is just dumb, no offence op.  A person can be religious but not bring it to work.  Also lack of religion does not mean the person will automatically be a better candidate.  There are fuckwad religious people, and there are fuckwad atheists.  Automatically excluding a group for their beliefs in their home, rather than their political goals is asinine.  I think it is more crippling to not vote for any one, rather than what you view as the lesser evil.	human
6426	Talk about a way to get vengeance..	human
6427	People like this enrage me.  Pushing an anti vaccine agenda is unbelievably dangerous to society and the health of those in it.  I know that they likely think they are doing something good.  But the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Ignorance seems to add great traction on the road as well.  Excellent points on the lack of data by the way.	human
6428	A nice mountain bike.  I loved that bike..  Have to give the thieves some credit though.  They sawed through the railing on my deck and took the bike with the steel cable running through the tires and frame.	human
6429	What kind of curry are you looking to make?  There are many varieties and some can taste dramatically different.  My standard curry mix would be non-vegetarian.  However if it is Indian style curry you want, get some Indian cook books or google indian curry recipes.  A lot of Indian food is not only vegetarian but damned tasty.  I say this as some one who loves meat in my food even.  But for what to add into a curry I would stick with something hearty like potatoes, carrots and onions as a base, maybe spinach or peas.  Then maybe add more veggies like cauliflower, celery and the like if you want to bulk it up	human
6430	Ok.  Personally I would recommend like a red or golden curry.  They are my personal favorites though.. I bet you could find a vegetarian mix that you just added water and veggies to.  I use S&amp;B curry mix most the times due to laziness.  But the mixes I use at least I checked the ingredients list, and they are not even vegetarian friendly.  Some mixes out there have decent enough flavor.  With a mix it would definitely meet the easy part.  Then you could also easily change up what you add into it.  Just fix some basmati or jasmine rice to put it over and you would be good to go.	human
6431	I know, it isn't just wrong, it is wrong when using itself as a reference.  I cracked up laughing when I saw this.	human
6432	"Nope, it has 1mm increments.  Also 24 is closer to 1"", since 25.4mm is one inch."	human
6433	Sadly it is a conversion chart.  I talked to the manager that made it.  Told him I was replacing it.	human
6434	My cat used to do that.  She would smack the drops of water as they ran down the curtain.  This was all fine and dandy till one day she got to engrossed in the fun and slipped.  So she goes tumbling into the bathtub under the shower faucet and proceeds to freak out.  After multiple attempts at using me as the high ground to climb up on I managed to slide the shower open and let her bolt.  Now I shut the door at home when I shower.	human
6435	While I have a beard.. I am saddened by the fact I have to watch how much sugar I eat.  I have always loved sugary foods, but my pancreas doesn't love me.	human
6436	likely the plug is a grate of some kind.  The gas from the blank has to go some where.  So it is likely vented out the end of the gun.  So if you had something like a rifle grenade, the tear gas canister could slide onto the barrel.  Then the gas from firing the blank would propel the canister. 	human
6437	Dark chocolate is by far my favorite of all the chocolates.  I even avoid that though more often than not.  Never been to a Trader Joe's.  I have heard they are pretty great though.  But thank you for the advice, I may try it to get rid of cravings!  	human
6438	But it looks like it is just the revolver for doing tear gas.	human
6439	Personally I use Winavr and AVR Studio in C to do my programming.  I haven't found a good book to start really.  Just picked up some beginner C books and started combing through them.  About the only other thing I could tell you is I started with this tutorial http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=93 and went through them all.  Wish I could point you in a better direction.  Only other advice I would give is go through the datasheets for whatever you are trying to work with.  They even have snippits of code in C.	human
6440	That is really more of question followed by a statement.  Rather than a debate.	human
6441	Great way to lose a finger or get bit by a water moccasin.	human
6442	It can still heavily sway something.  Also you can potentially drown out a candidate you dislike.  Just run so many advertisements that you take up a high chunk of the available advertisement slots.  The issue is some one willing to look out for a corporation can gain a generally large advantage over one who has a different view.	human
6443	They definitely do that now.  The issue is now they can do more of it.	human
6444	I just lack faith in my fellow voters.  That is why this concerns me.  Looking into it, it should be easy to see what is going on.  But at least most the people I know do not look into things.	human
6445	If we followed advice or something to that affect, would it then be inappropriate to give a thank you and show the results?	human
6446	The issue then would be alcohol is very high in calories.  It may make a change that lowers the calories some what.  But I would think breaking down sugars that are tough to digest and then converting them to alcohol would be counter productive.	human
6447	I would if I could.  Sadly I do not have a place underneath the tank to put anything.  So I am pretty much going to have to go the hang on route if I have any kind of refugium.  But I am looking forward to the ability to having more than 10 gallons.	human
6448	For my shoulders to fit a shirt, I have to go to a size larger than the rest of my frame requires.   I end up with a shirt that is to long for me and looks silly if I do not tuck it in.	human

6450	To bad you can't write it off on your taxes as a donation.	human
6451	Yes.  I have had my friends question me for wanting to know how everything works.  They think I am strange for that.  I find that for me it also hampers my social abilities.	human
6452	This guy has been at this forever.  Thank you so much for posting this!	human
6453	Because this is a community.  Part of being in a community is dealing with things we do not like.  Having lots of people means that some will have different views and ideology apart from yourself.  The general channel is just that, general.  The place that indeedtosortmylifeout pointed out, it has only been around for an hour.  So no one would have even had the ability to post to it previously.	human
6454	While I agree with you in principle it still is something the community decides.  These posts get upvoted more than downvoted.  That means a majority of people voting are interested in it even if it is pretty obviously fake.  So ultimately they ARE of interest to the general community despite what you think, unless you think the minority should have ultimate rule.  If they get downvoted more than upvoted, then it never hits the front page and most people do not have to deal with it.  There are things that drive me nuts that reddit does, but I do not think that every one else should think like me.  That is why the only tool you really have is to downvote things.	human
6455	Hrmmm That is a long ways to drive for a 75 cent packet of yeast..  I have heard people tossing in raisins to unstick the fermentation, though I do not know why that works.  It could just be that it introduces new yeast that was on the grapes.  Also I suppose if you brewed the cider there is possibly some live yeast in it.  You could try starting some on the side and seeing if there is some action after a while.  But one factor I would conciser is cost.  How much did the entire batch cost you versus the cost of fuel.  With only one gallon of mead I would be more likely to try the cider or raisin method.	human
6456	You're?	human
6457	Just a guess.  But I guess it would depend on the strength and mass of the material.  If it was very very strong but very low mass it may be possible to build an object big enough that the opposites sides did not influence each other with gravity.  This would probably have to be an artificial structure.  But really the size would be dependent on knowing the mass and strength ultimately.  Given enough gravitational force anything will collapse into a singularity.	human

6460	I could see it having some advantages.  Less likely some one would steal your fancy rifle.	human
6461	Haven't really dealt with many books.  I am opposite from you, I am a beginning programmer but hardware I know pretty well.  So mainly I just have C books I am reading.  I would recommend things like this tutorial on embedded electronics http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=57 and something like this $50 starting robot http://www.societyofrobots.com/step_by_step_robot.shtml  If you ever have questions on hardware though feel free to ask.  I love talking about this kind of stuff.   -edit- Also what are the kind of projects you want to do?	human
6462	That sounds like a neat project.  Any idea what MCU you want to be the brains?  That seems like it would be a good starting project to me personally.  You can also piecemeal the thing together.  You could use the equivalent of printf for whatever language you are working in and print to your screen if the MCU has USART or something else you can use.  Figure out if it is reading the temperature probe correctly before you move on.	human
6463	How did you find out he had a conceal and carry permit?	human
6464	My guess is if this sunk your morale that fast you were never any where near as confident as you thought.  Maybe try to look at it like window shopping.  It can be fun to look at things you wouldn't even want to buy so to speak.  To me it sounds like you are obsessing over this whole thing.  Also if you try to control him the relationship probably isn't worth much any ways or it will make him jump ship faster than you can blink.  You are young and so you haven't experienced a lot of adult life yet.  Maybe try to do something to raise your self esteem, take some dancing classes, martial arts, work out at a gym, go running.  This kind of thing or any hobby along that line will help you feel better about yourself and also distract you from obsessing.  -edit-  Oh slight side note.  Changing people does not work.  Do not try to change a person for yourself.  If he watches porn and you pestering him makes him say he won't it is no good.  Most likely he will feel like he has to bend over backwards for something he views as perfectly fine just to please you or hide it from you.	human
6465	Not if you view the hard drive as an entire world.  Throwing trash in a land fill does not clear up space, it moves the object into a different empty space.  It is more akin to defragging the hard drive.  A computer recycling bin once you empty it, the stuff disappears(as far as the OS is concerned.)	human
6466	Your mother must be so proud of you..	human

6476	Is that a Giant Palouse Earthworm?	human
6477	I could take a bunch of guesses but I do not know for sure.  My best guess, I think one of the things would be exposure length.  Even the Hubble takes in its light over long durations of time to get those sharp pictures.  Pluto is not stationary, so you can not leave the shutter open to show the detail.	human
6478	No don't delete it.  If you follow rediquette one of the things is it is perfectly fine to post old stuff.	human
6479	Oh no, I always expect every one to do that.  I just wanted the poster to know that they shouldn't feel bad about it.	human

6482	Pure ethanol freezes at -170 or so Fahrenheit..  So without doing any math I would guess that your freezer would have to be around -50 or colder for any of the water to crystallize in an ethanol blend.	human
6483	It is to prevent people from spamming I believe.  Nothing to do with the servers most likely.	human

6490	Can't help you to much.  But one thing important is to get a quality brand.  Your life can literally rely on a dive knife, so do not buy a lower quality blade.  Stainless alloys and titanium may be a way to go.  High carbon in salt water is asking for rust for the most part.	human
6491	Depends on what kind of home repairs or projects you are doing.  I have found a cordless circular saw to be amazingly useful once I got one.  Also it never hurts to have a set of hex wrenches and torx wrenches, Socket wrenches, crescent wrench, drill, coping saw and more.  I could keep going, but it will be spendy depending on where you get them.  Also having an idea of what you plan to do would be useful.  Garage sales like Tsoldrin said are a great place.	human
6492	Fair enough.  I would definitely recommend a multimeter with continuity settings, soldering iron, solder and electrical tape too if you ever plan on messing with electricity.  Oh and wire strippers are damned useful if dealing with wiring.	human
6493	Got an example of what they ask? or a link to a thread?	human
6494	Trolling is a subtle art.  New account so I think they are just trying to get their technique down.	human
6495	Shortest lived troll ever!  Already deleted their account.   -edit-  Does it make me a bad person I do not even care if they deleted their account in tears of failure?	human
6496	Especially if you go to the source that the blogger sited.  There is a submit satire button on their main menu.	human
6497	Objects going slow crash when they hit each other.  Objects going super fast still crash when they hit each other.  Also anything with mass can not go the speed of light.  At this speed an objects mass is infinite.  Because of infinite mass it would take infinite energy to accelerate it to this speed.  But assuming it is going a bit below the speed of light when it impacts.. You would have a release of energy on par with a nuclear bomb at the very least.  The amount of energy on release would be immense.  When two protons collide it busts it apart into smaller bits.  Those smaller bits will be various types of energy, photons being in that group.  You would have a release of gamma radiation and heat that would be devastating.  As well as the kinetic energy that would transfer into the surrounding mass would fling things with force that is hard to conceive in our average scope of the world.	human

6500	"It was on Halloween, luckily it never came to blows.  My friends were drinking and some what upset that the bar had last call half an hour before they had to.  So not being able to procure any more alcohol they hit the street.  Well a female friend of mine was being load and she ended up pissing off some drunk guy.  They argue and it continues escalating at a pretty quick rate.  My friend wants to beat the shit out of the guy and he didn't want to fight her because of his ""chivalry"".  So finally I step in between them because I can see that fists will be swung soon.  Even though I think my friend was being an idiot,  I didn't want her to go to jail and have to explain it to her fiance.  So now the guy starts screaming he is going to kick the crap out of me, since he can't hit her being because he is chivalrous.  This continued on for a few minutes before they finally cooled the fuck off.  But the thing that cracked me up was the guy wanting to kick the crap out of me, the person breaking up a potential fight due to his chivalry."	human

6505	The speed of light always changes about when going through stuff.  The whole C as a constant is the speed of light in vacuum.  In fact some times particles go faster than light in a material.  It creates http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation	human
6506	I would argue that would be more in line with the field of Biological Systems Engineering.  But I personally think it would be doable.  Just would need to be amazingly thick tanks, compressed gas at the top to keep the pressure up and possibly refrigeration units to keep the temp right.	human
6507	But what would be said if the person was going 100mph for their dog and hit a car with a family in it?  I think the officer should have shown more compassion, but the people driving the car were also putting every one else on the road at risk.	human
6508	Also I think it is unfair that we punish drunk drivers who do not kill people.	human

The things that I would still want to do in life would be very difficult after an apocalypse.  That and I have a level of OCD in certain situations.  I twitch when things are ""wrong"" in my mind, and I dislike injustice heavily.  I would be trying to get things back up and running to where people could begin again.  I love building things, so to a point that is also my recreation.  -edit-  That and if you hang out with me to help rebuild things.. I have a guns to ward off Maximumcharacterlimi"	human
6514	Hell even if one doesn't exist.. Make your own.  You may have to go on a small quest to gather parts, but they are out there.  Or better yet, get yourself a 100 ton, or a 150 ton earth mover.	human
6515	I would think that ID'ing the object of removal was considered highly important.	human
6516	For washing hands.  We had these at the grade school I went to.  The bar by your feet turns on the sink.	human
6517	I have found it is a matter of force.  I used to have that issue but it was mainly because I was whacking the egg to softly.  I usually try and give it one good crack against the corner of the counter or a bowl, maybe a second one if the first one didn't create a great crack.	human
6518	That is a neat background you have.  Any chance of uploading just that?	human
6519	I have never been in a situation like that, so I can't offer you any first hand experience.  Personally I say fuck what he wants.  Do this for you and/or your children, if you want to, but not because he wants to.  What you need to ask yourself is can you walk away without guilt, if so then do it, if not then see him.  Also is this something your kid would want?  If they want to see him, then that should weigh some in your decision.	human
6520	Nope, also on win 7 and it worked fine.	human
6521	Thanks a ton!	human
6522	Probably should have a NSFW tag on that.	human
6523	I also want to say thanks.  Been in two situations where I was worried I may have to draw my firearm, but none that close.  Glad you came out on top.	human
6524	Having gone to a lot of IPSC competitions I disagree.  A lot of people suck at shooting, but there are also those who are perfectly skilled at it.	human
6525	not against the statement that 'nobody' can shoot.  But I would definitely agree most people can not shoot well.  But yes, the people at the competition are above average.	human
6526	Very true.  This is where drilling comes into play.  You want to go shooting at least once a month, preferably more if you carry a firearm.  It is the same in martial arts.  Keep drilling until it becomes instinct.  Then your chances of missing while still there they are much smaller.	human
6527	Well sorry the cake was ruined.  But happy birthday any ways!	human
6528	Self defense and murder are just different applications of the same tool.  I carried a concealed weapon for years.  The reason I started was two fold.  Had some run ins with wild animals in the woods and wanted to have the legal ability of pushing my pistol under a seat of the car so it wasn't in plain sight.  Then a year later I had a couple guys try to mug me at knife point, luckily I was on my way to go camping and just seeing the holster thankfully disarmed the situation so to speak.  After the parking lot situation I began carrying full time instead of just on the way to the woods.  Now I am sure we will disagree on many aspects.  But I took classes and had a federal level background check ran,  people wanting to do bad things usually won't go through that trouble.  With the logic of carrying something designed to cause harm can carry over.  What about fighting styles like Krav Maga?  Those people who are taking it are learning how to harm or kill humans!  does this mean you need to be worried about all those crazy krav maga people in the world?	human
6529	I make fried rice that for some reason every one loves despite only two changes from the norm.  Only things different I do is use Basmati rice and olive oil.  Gives it a very distinct flavor.	human
6530	Keep an antlion in a jar of sand.	human
6531	I have a feeling the hoarding is at least slowing down.  Store I work at is getting a stockpile of ammo built back up again.  So at least in my area every one is happy with no longer hoarding, or the surplus they saved up.	human
6532	Here you go, best I could do http://imgur.com/iuhHP.jpg the reds are a little bright, but least it is less yellow...	human
6533	Here is my try http://imgur.com/iuhHP.jpg  -edit-  By the way, fantastic job with the flag!	human
6534	yea, I am kind of lazy that way.  What I should have done is trace around the red on the couch and the flag with the pen tool and tweak their color separately..  But I figured it was better with being less yellow :P	human
6535	That does look pretty good.  But like I said.  I was to lazy to shop it correctly :P	human
6536	Thank you for introducing me to those.  Brightened my day.	human
6537	I know where I work we do not allow OC because for every person that carries openly, we get 5 complaints.  It is sad how many people are afraid and/or ignorant.	human

6539	She is some one who is relatively well known on reddit.  Been a member for years.  Also no such thing as a stupid question.	human
6540	No problem.  I think it is because there was a request for her to do an AMA.  So she was likely on the OP's front page and it irked him.  Just a guess though.	human
6541	Wow I am out of the loop then, first I have heard of this.  Thanks for the info.	human
6542	I want my minute back.	human
6543	I am a huge fan of gil hibben throwing knives.  They are well priced for the quality.  He also wrote a pretty cheap book that I found very useful.  You can also find a lot of the info online if you just look through enough data.	human
6544	While I agree with you, can't blame the person though for being hesitant on coming forward.  Seeing the reaction people had to Saydrah could give people pause.  Though the people of reddit would likely be less angry at any other person due to no conflict of interest and less possible scandal to latch onto.  Frankly I would like to see every one from both parties have 'sorries' to say to each other.	human
6545	I would go an economic route.  If you could just get one invention that would get a corporation started.  Military development, medical research, resource collection and energy would all be good fields.  The scheme to take over the world would be very long indeed, medical research would be a priority to branch into.  Get yourself the ability to rejuvenate your body, or at least slow or stop the rate you age.  Trying brute force will fail.  To many people with to many guns.  That and desperate parties can throw nukes around then you will be ruling radioactive rubble.  Edge your way in slowly using money.  Goes with the whole frog in boiling water analogy.	human

6547	What is your level of experience with AVR's?	human
6548	I do not hate you and the only reason I think reddit is better is the community.	human
6549	This is your second post in a short order of time about digg and reddit.. What the hell is your obsession with it?	human
6550	Very neat!  Once I get a USB programmer I hope to pick it up again as a hobby.  My parallel port programmer hates windows 7.. or rather windows 7 hates it.  I wish I could point you in a good direction.  All I can do is ask questions you probably already thought of.  Is it going to be a machine outputting the Morse code or a person?  Because if it is a person that will make it tougher.  Maybe something like this might help in your programming as well http://morsecode.scphillips.com/jtranslator.html 	human
6551	Are we to imagine this? or was there supposed to be a link?	human
6552	I can't believe I have never seen this before.	human
6553	It could be fun.  Though I would actually just like to get together with other reddit shooters.  	human
6554	That sounds like a pretty good plan to me for starters.  Also I would think analog noise will be less of an issue because Morse code is a very slow digital transmission basically.  I would love to be tinkering on a project like that, I love problem solving.	human
6555	I know a lot of places have laser trips in large stores.  At least places I have worked in the past just put a laser trip going across the entrance of the isles to supplement motion scanners.  Though as well thought out as this plan was, I doubt they wouldn't have just stepped over the beams..	human
6556	I say definitely go for it.	human
6557	North Idaho.  Moscow/Pullman area specifically.	human
6558	Hah that is true.  Maybe we should just call the whole northwest as our area?	human
6559	I am a bad person, I couldn't help but to laugh.	human
6560	Hah I know, this is a semantics argument, but the third definition of propaganda is 'the particular doctrines or principles propagated by an organization or movement.'.  So if we started spreading the word, truth or not it becomes propaganda.	human
6561	Who knows.  But the thing is the amount of people going there because they allow open carry is likely close to the amount who are temporarily boycotting it.  In just a couple days they got 28,000 signatures and it is growing.  I just think there needs to be a show of support saying we are now going there because of this policy.	human
6562	Get a room you two.	human
6563	No need to ask that.  Obviously it does blend.	human
6564	Call them.  An employee may grab it for you and hold onto it in the store.	human
6565	That is not your only problem.	human
6566	Get some double stick tape, tape her keyboard, mouse, coffee mug or anything else to her desk.	human
6567	I see the UK as a pretty awesome European country.  I do not think the UK weak.  Main reasons the US would beat the UK in certain areas is population.  There is just more of us in the US.  As far as tiny? Kind of.  I live in a state that is just about the same size as all of the UK, but land mass isn't something I see as really important.  I have always viewed the UK as a great ally and the people pretty cool.	human
6568	Congratulations man and Happy Birthday!	human
6569	Might I point out, a 'fat ass' with a wife who was in playboy.	human
6570	Some ranges will let you rent a gun.  Also there are classes for conceal and carry like Hekalus said.  You can also take a general class like hunters education that will teach you the basics of firearms, though other things like animal track recognition would be pointless unless you were curious.  If you are in a larger city I am sure you can find classes, and if you are in a small community I bet you could find a friend to show you the basics.	human
6571	It's all fun and games till the cat craps on your pillow that night.	human
6572	Heck yea I would.	human
6573	Redundancy is the key to a secure computer.	human
6574	While neat and all, this is just a concept it seems.  There is no information on the bio battery other than it runs longer than a lithium ion.  No mention of the current it can provide.  More information would be fantastic.	human
6575	Wow I wish I had a room mate like that.  Best thing one of mine ever did was rarely cook a meal for every one.	human
6576	Damned, that feels like a dagger in your heart as that realization comes to you.  I feel your pain.	human
6577	I haven't had one done.  But after I became a diabetic they did one to my sister.  As far as I could tell it is pretty much just how it sounds.  You just do not eat the night before, you drink some sugar water the next day and you get your blood drawn a bunch of times.  At least with her they put in one of those IV needles and taped it to her arm.  That way they didn't actually stick her with a needle multiple times.  Hope that at least answers some of your questions.	human
6578	I love breasts as much as the next dude.  But be courteous and put NSFW on that.	human
6579	It could be that you are intimidated/scared/(insert other emotion) because you are a virgin.  You could very well be psyching yourself out.	human
6580	lol no worries.  Even the best of us put stuff in the wrong reddit at times.  Also luckily I am actually not at work today.	human
6581	It is all personal preference.  Perhaps some people find squares far more aesthetically pleasing than triangles?	human
6582	Personally I do not think replacing the thermostat will increase the efficiency.  Main reasons modern fridges are more efficient is in part do to the microcontrollers and the modern thermostats.  But a lot of it has to do with how they are manufactured, what they are insulated with and the efficiency of the compressor and the motor driving the compressor.  That being said, I do not think it is a bad idea to replace the thermostat.  Nor do I think the efficiency is likely to be a massive expense.  A good place to ask would likely be the electronics subreddit as well.	human
6583	Yea, but on the bright side.  They were usually built tough as hell back then.  Just not as efficient typically.	human
6584	I love the wilderness in the north west.  It is amazing the spectrum of wilderness that is around here.  Very awesome picture.	human
6585	But what cirrus45 is doing with the pictures isn't making him upset?	human
6586	Wow that is an amazing looking place.  I will need to see if I can head out there one of these days.  It is not as scenic in pictures but figured I would share one of my favorite spots http://imgur.com/t5SZc 	human
6587	It is in southern Idaho.  Owyhee County, south of Grandview.	human
6588	I love the Sawtooths.  I have never backpacked through it though,  I bet it is great.  I used to go to Stanley Lake every year for camping.	human
6589	I have wanted to get back into camping/backpacking.  If I can drag one of my friends along I may try and do that this year.  A place you might also like is the Selway-Bitterroot area in Idaho.	human
6590	Wow, spam fail.  You realize you haven't actually linked to anything?	human
6591	I would think it was adorable.  But I could see some dudes having issues with it.	human
6592	That is heart wrenching.	human
6593	Sometimes people aren't subscribed to the same subreddits as you.	human
6594	Or .684%	human
6595	My only point was that 2.1 million Americans is not a large chunk of people that think something is the best.  I would assume a higher percentage of people would like the post.	human
6596	As a fellow diabetic I have to ask, how are your sugars?  If my sugars are out of whack I can not sleep well.  If I even run high earlier in the day, then they are in check by the time I go to bed due to everything I can't get to sleep easily.  Low sugars also can botch my ability to sleep that whole day.    Diet and exercise also have a large roll in this.  Eat well balanced meals, though probably doing this any ways I would imagine.  Also doing some cardio exercise 3-4 times a week can help a hell of a lot.	human
6597	Toss up really.. Either my computer, or my AR-15 that I modded for competition.	human
6598	When do you do the exercise?  Also it takes usually a couple of weeks of sticking with it before things start evening out with workouts.  Oh also keep a regular bedtime/morning time.  Going to bed at erratic hours can mess with your sleeping cycle.	human
6599	Being part of a group doesn't make people smarter or dumber.  Not sure if that is fortunate or not..	human
6600	A doctor may be some one to see then.  It could be something involved with your hormones, a chemical imbalance and likely hundreds of other issues.  Have you ever tried things like melatonin?  I have heard they work wonders for some people.  Though if you have something medical keeping you from sleeping, it is always better to see a doc rather than self medicate.  -edit-  On the bright side, if you see an endocrinologist for your diabetes they may have a good idea if it is a hormonal issue.	human
6601	I would be curious to see your reasoning on all of this.. But hell I will play.  My most 'conservative' views would be on firearms in both ownership and law.  I am very much for more freedom with the ownership of them.  I think the US needs to keep its nose out of other nations business more often than not, this includes the way we spend money on aid that we send some nations.  that is really about it.	human
6602	Also if you do not have insurance, donate blood.  They do an iron test for free, and donating can save lives.	human
6603	Me, next question.	human
6604	Absolutely not.  They tend to take them and scatter them about in different hiding positions.  They are a firm believer in not leaving all of your eggs in one basket so to speak.  They then forget where they bury the damned things.  They then begin to get lazy and apathetic about their job, they then begin to steal nuts believing it is their right for doing a good job.	human
6605	-edit- hah you mean yours.  I was confused for a moment there as to what I edited.	human
